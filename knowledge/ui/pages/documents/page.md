# Documents

## Purpose
Central library for frameworks, policies, procedures, templates, and guides with status and version tracking.

## When to use
Use this page to locate a document, check its status, compare versions, or validate approvals.

## How to use
1. Filter by document type or status on the left panel.
2. Search by code, title, or category.
3. Select a document to view details, versions, and actions.
4. Use the data type filter to focus on demo, template, or client documents.

## Key data
Document code, type, status, version, owner, and last-updated metadata.

## Data Types
Documents display a **DataTypeBadge** indicating their classification:
- **Demo** (orange) - Sample documents for demonstration and training
- **Template** (teal) - Standard document templates for reuse
- **Client** (green) - Production client documents

The badge appears in both the list view (next to document title) and the detail pane. Use data type filtering in the left panel to focus on specific classifications.
