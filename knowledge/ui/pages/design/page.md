# Design

## Purpose
Create and maintain governance artifacts before plans go live, including policies, templates, and framework mappings.

## When to use
Use this page when authoring or updating policies, building template sections, or reviewing framework coverage.

## How to use
1. Start with Policy Library to review or draft governance policies.
2. Use Plan Templates to assemble sections for new plans.
3. Open Frameworks to map policies to governance pillars.
4. Check Governance Matrix, Gap Analysis, and Document Links for coverage and relationships.

## Key data
Policy counts, template section counts, framework totals, and plan analysis metrics used for coverage visibility.
