# Plans

## Purpose
Provide lifecycle management for compensation plans, including drafts, approvals, and publishing.

## When to use
Use this page to create a new plan, edit an existing plan, or track plan status.

## How to use
1. Create a plan from scratch or from a template.
2. Add sections, calculations, and policy-aligned clauses.
3. Submit for approval and monitor status through publication.
4. Use filters to narrow by plan type or status.

## Key data
Plan status, version history, approval state, and associated documents.

## Data Types
Plans display a **DataTypeBadge** indicating their classification:
- **Demo** (orange) - Sample plans for demonstration purposes
- **Template** (teal) - Reusable plan templates for standardization
- **Client** (green) - Production client plans

The badge appears next to the plan title in the card view. Use this to quickly distinguish between sample data and production plans.
