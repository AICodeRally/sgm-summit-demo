# Templates

## Purpose
Define reusable plan templates and section libraries that standardize plan creation.

## When to use
Use this page when creating new plan templates or updating standard sections.

## How to use
1. Choose a template to edit or create a new template.
2. Add or revise sections to reflect governance policy requirements.
3. Save the template and share with plan authors.
4. Filter by plan type (Compensation, Governance, Policy).

## Key data
Template names, section counts, policy mappings, and last updated metadata.

## Data Types
Templates display a **DataTypeBadge** indicating their classification:
- **Demo** (orange) - Sample templates for demonstration purposes
- **Template** (teal) - System or standard templates (most common for this page)
- **Client** (green) - Client-specific customized templates

System templates are marked as `isSystemTemplate: true` and cannot be deleted. They serve as the foundation for creating client-specific plans.
