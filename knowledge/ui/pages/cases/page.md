# Cases

## Purpose
Manage disputes and exceptions across the organization.

## When to use
Use this page to review, prioritize, and update cases.

## How to use
1. Filter cases by status, priority, or case type.
2. Open a case to review evidence and history.
3. Update status or route for approval.
4. Monitor SLA indicators for response deadlines.

## Key data
Case status, priority, SLA, owner, and linked policies.

## Data Types
Cases display a **DataTypeBadge** indicating their classification:
- **Demo** (orange) - Sample cases for training and demonstration
- **Template** (teal) - Template case workflows for reference
- **Client** (green) - Production client cases requiring resolution

The badge appears next to the case title in the list view. Client cases require action within SLA; demo cases can be used for workflow training.
