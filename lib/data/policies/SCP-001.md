# 6. Recovery Mechanisms
Henry Schein will use the following methods to recover overpaid compensation, listed in order of preference:
## 6.1 Payroll Deduction (Primary Method)
For active employees, recovery through payroll deduction is the preferred method. Key provisions:
• Maximum deduction per pay period: 25% of net variable compensation
• Minimum deduction amount: $500 per pay period (if balance exceeds $2,000)
• Employee will receive 60-day advance written notice before deductions begin
• Recovery plan must be completed within 12 months unless special circumstances exist
• State wage law requirements will be followed for all deductions
## 6.2 Voluntary Repayment Agreement
Employees may opt for a voluntary repayment schedule as an alternative to payroll deduction:
• Written repayment agreement signed by employee and company
• Payment schedule negotiated based on amount owed and employee circumstances
• Minimum monthly payment of $500 or 10% of outstanding balance, whichever is greater
• Interest may be charged at company's cost of capital rate on balances exceeding $10,000
## 6.3 Offset Against Future Payments
Recovery may be achieved by reducing future commission or bonus payments:
• Applied when current period has insufficient compensation for payroll deduction
• May be used in combination with payroll deduction
• Employee must be notified in writing before offset is applied
## 6.4 Final Paycheck Recovery
For terminated employees, recovery from final compensation payments:
• Subject to state law requirements regarding final pay deductions
• Requires written authorization in states that mandate employee consent
• May not reduce final pay below minimum wage requirements
## 6.5 Direct Payment Request
When other methods are not available or practical:
• Written demand for payment sent via certified mail
• 30-day payment deadline from date of notice
• May pursue legal action if payment is not received

# 8. Tracking and Documentation Requirements
The Sales Compensation team must maintain comprehensive records of all clawbacks:

# 9. Appeals Process
Employees have the right to appeal any clawback decision. The appeals process provides a fair mechanism to address disputed clawbacks.
## 9.1 Filing an Appeal
• Employee must submit written appeal within 30 days of initial notification
• Appeal must include specific reasons for disputing the clawback

• Conduct employee interview if requested
• Issue written decision with rationale

• Reduced payment amounts
• Temporary suspension of recovery (up to 90 days)
Hardship requests require documentation and approval by VP of Sales Compensation and HR.
## 10.2 Small Balance Write-Offs
Clawback amounts under $100 may be written off at the discretion of the Sales Compensation Manager when the cost of recovery exceeds the amount owed.
## 10.3 Deceased or Disabled Employees
Special provisions apply in cases of employee death or permanent disability. Legal counsel must be consulted before pursuing recovery in these situations.
## 10.4 Statute of Limitations
Henry Schein will not pursue clawbacks more than 24 months from the original payment date, except in cases of fraud or intentional misconduct where longer statutory periods may apply.
# 11. Examples and Scenarios
## Example 1: Customer Cancellation
Sales Rep closes a $500,000 deal in Q1 and receives $25,000 commission. In Q3, the customer cancels the order, resulting in a $125,000 GP reversal. The clawback is $25,000 and requires approval from VP of Sales Compensation and Finance. The rep is notified 60 days in advance, and recovery occurs through payroll deduction at $2,500 per month over 10 months.
## Example 2: Calculation Error
Due to a system error, Sales Rep was paid at 8% commission rate instead of 6%, resulting in a $3,500 overpayment. The error is discovered three months later. The Sales Compensation Manager approves the clawback, and recovery occurs via offset against the next commission payment, with 60-day notice provided.
## Example 3: Bad Debt Write-Off
Sales Rep earned $15,000 commission on a $300,000 sale. Nine months later, the customer files bankruptcy and the invoice is written off as bad debt. The $15,000 clawback requires Director-level approval. Given the rep's current low variable compensation, a 12-month voluntary repayment plan is arranged at $1,250 per month.
