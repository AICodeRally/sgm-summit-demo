# SALES CREDITING POLICY

**Policy Code:** SCP-001
**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** APPROVED
**Effective Date:** January 1, 2026

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This policy establishes standardized rules for crediting sales transactions to compensation plans. It ensures fair and consistent treatment of all sales representatives, particularly in complex scenarios involving multiple contributors.

---

## 1. PURPOSE & SCOPE

**Purpose:** Define when and how sales transactions are credited to individual commission plans.

**Scope:** Applies to all direct sales representatives (AEs, SAEs, KAMs) and overlay roles (SEs, CS reps) in all regions (AMER, EMEIA, APAC, EDU).

---

## 2. FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES

- **Single Primary Credit:** Each transaction has one primary account owner responsible for the transaction credit
- **Fairness:** Credit rules are applied consistently across all reps and segments
- **Transparency:** All reps understand crediting rules for their segment and role
- **Documentation:** All multi-rep transactions documented with credit split and rationale
- **Clarity:** Rules are simple enough that reps can predict outcomes

---

## 3. PRIMARY CREDITING RULES BY TRANSACTION TYPE

### NEW LOGO DEALS

**Definition:** First-time customer purchases (no prior ARR with JAMF)

**Primary Credit:** Account Development Rep (New Logo team member)
- 100% commission credit to AE who closed the deal
- Regardless of opportunity source or territory

**Territory Assignment:** New Logo rep gets credit if:
- Territory assigned at deal close date
- OR opportunity sourced/created by new logo rep
- OR new logo deal brought in from channel and new logo rep provided support

**Multi-rep Scenarios:**
- **New Logo + Named Account Support:** 100% to New Logo, Named Account SE/CSM receives separate incentive if applicable
- **Territory Source + New Logo Closer:** New Logo rep gets 100% (effort closest to close)
- **Channel + New Logo:** New Logo rep gets 100% if deal registration with JAMF

**Examples:**
- New Logo AE closes deal for Microsoft ($500K ARR) → 100% to New Logo AE
- Channel partner sources Microsoft, New Logo AE qualifies and closes → 100% to New Logo AE
- Named Account manager brings in Microsoft (existing relationship) → 0% to New Logo (not a new logo to JAMF)

---

### NAMED ACCOUNT DEALS (Existing Customers)

**Definition:** Expansion, renewal, or retention of existing account relationships

**Primary Credit:** Account Manager/KAM assigned to account
- Assigned based on account ownership at deal close date
- 100% credit to assigned account owner
- If deal involves multiple territories, credit to rep with largest existing ARR

**Territory Assignment Rules:**
- Account assigned to rep at time of opportunity creation (in Salesforce)
- Account changes documented with effective date
- Legacy accounts credited to prior owner if deal closes within 90 days of territory change

**Multi-rep Scenarios:**
- **Account Split (two AEs):** Split 50/50 or per documented account split (e.g., 70/30 if large/small split)
- **Overlay Involvement (SE, CSM):** 100% to account manager; SE/CSM receives SPIF if applicable
- **Territory Boundary:** Credit to rep with largest existing ARR in account

**Expansion Examples:**
- Existing customer (Microsoft) expansion from $100K to $150K → 100% to Account Manager assigned to Microsoft
- Existing customer split 70/30 between two reps, $50K expansion → 70% to Lead AE, 30% to Secondary AE

---

### RENEWAL & RETENTION DEALS

**Definition:** Customer renews for another contract term (same or higher value)

**Primary Credit:** Account Manager responsible for renewal
- Assigned to account owner at renewal opportunity creation
- 100% credit to assigned owner

**At-Risk Renewals:**
- If renewal at risk, credit to whoever saves deal (AE, CSM, sales leader)
- Document reason for at-risk status and intervention

**Churn Prevention:**
- Proactive renewal (100% to account manager)
- Reactive renewal (saved from churn) may split with CSM or intervention rep

---

## 4. OVERLAY ROLE CREDITING

### Sales Engineers (SEs)

**Territory Alignment:**
- SEs assigned to territories/accounts (per Territory Framework)
- SE credit contingent on active involvement in deal

**Credit Rules:**
- **Primary AE Support:** 0% commission credit (covered under AE plan)
- **SEs receive:** Separate plan with GARR/Gross Retention metrics
- **Multi-SE Deals:** Credit split per documented involvement

**Crediting Trigger:** SE must be involved in demo, POC, or technical evaluation

---

### Customer Success Managers (CSMs)

**Renewal/Retention Credit:**
- CSM involved in renewal: Separate commission plan
- CSM credit for retention: 0% - CSM compensated via separate plan
- CS Variable Pay Plan: 80% Gross Renewal / 20% Net Renewal

**Documentation:** CSM involvement in renewal documented in Salesforce

---

## 5. TERRITORY CONFLICT RESOLUTION

**Overlapping Territories:**
Rule of precedence:
1. Account owner (primary) - gets primary credit
2. Territory of opportunity source - if no owner assigned
3. Territory of deal close location - if unclear
4. Manager determination - if still unclear

**Boundary Disputes:**
- Document in account record if territory boundary dispute
- Escalate to Regional Manager for determination
- Apply going forward until territory adjusted

**Examples:**
- Customer in Territory A wants to use vendor from Territory B → Credit to Territory A (account owner)
- Account sold to Territory B mid-deal → Credit to Territory A if deal closes within 30 days of transfer
- After 30 days → Credit to Territory B (new owner)

---

## 6. CHANNEL CREDITING RULES

### Deal Registration Crediting

**Reseller/Partner Deals:**
- Credit to JAMF rep who registered deal with partner
- OR credit to JAMF rep supporting deal
- Territory assignment rule: Territory of partner relationship owner

**SPIF Consideration:**
- Partners may receive SPIF (separate from direct sales comp)
- Multi-year deal SPIF: 2% of bookings to eligible JAMF reps
- Segment conversion SPIF: Extra quota retirement per SPIF policy

---

## 7. MULTI-REP TRANSACTION SPLITS

**Scenarios Requiring Splits:**
1. Account split 60/40 between two reps
2. Territory boundary deal
3. Transition period (first 30 days after transfer)
4. Multi-office/multi-territory customer

**Split Documentation:**
- Document in Salesforce deal record
- Obtain manager approval if not standard split
- File split approval form (see Exception Request Process)
- Communicate split to both reps in writing

**Common Splits:**
- 50/50 - Co-selling arrangement
- 70/30 - Account primary/secondary split
- Territory-based - Per account assignment split

**New Logo Exception:**
- New Logo deals do NOT split (100% to primary)
- Unless explicit co-development or co-ownership (rare)

---

## 8. CREDITING EXAMPLES BY SEGMENT

### New Logo Segment
- **Scenario:** AE1 sources lead, AE2 closes deal
  - **Credit:** 100% AE2 (closer)
- **Scenario:** Partner sources, JAMF New Logo AE qualifies and closes
  - **Credit:** 100% New Logo AE

### Named Account Segment
- **Scenario:** Account Manager (AE1) assigned to account, AE1 closes $150K expansion
  - **Credit:** 100% AE1
- **Scenario:** AE1 and AE2 co-manage account (documented 60/40 split)
  - **Credit:** 60% AE1, 40% AE2

### Upmarket/Strategic Segment
- **Scenario:** KAM manages $1M+ account, closes $500K expansion
  - **Credit:** 100% KAM
- **Scenario:** Deal involves multiple territories (East Coast + West Coast)
  - **Credit:** To KAM with largest existing ARR or documented split

---

## 9. SPECIAL SITUATIONS

### Manager Sourced Deals
- Credit to manager's quota (as account owner)
- Typically for deals needing leadership (large, complex, at-risk)
- Document manager involvement and rationale

### Lost-to-Won Deals
- Original sourcing rep gets NO credit if different rep closes
- Credit goes to rep who closed the deal

### Legacy Customers (Acquisitions/Mergers)
- New JAMF customers from M&A: New Logo credit
- If pre-existing JAMF relationship: Assigned account owner credit

### Do-Not-Credit Situations
- Professional services-only deals (no software sale)
- Pilot programs not converting to paid license
- Free or promotional licenses
- Insider sales (not JAMF reps - e.g., executive relationships)
