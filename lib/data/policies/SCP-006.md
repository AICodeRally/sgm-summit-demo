| Approved By: | Pending Legal & Executive Review |

# 1. Purpose
This policy establishes compliance standards for state wage and hour laws affecting sales compensation across Henry Schein's multi-state operations. State laws impose varying requirements for commission agreements, payment timing, final pay, and recordkeeping. This policy ensures Henry Schein complies with all applicable state requirements while maintaining consistent compensation practices.
# 2. Scope
This policy applies to:
• All sales compensation arrangements for employees working in the United States
• Commission, bonus, and incentive payments subject to state wage laws
• Final payment obligations upon termination
• Written commission agreement requirements
• State-specific recordkeeping and disclosure obligations
# 3. State Wage Law Overview
## 3.1 Why State Compliance Matters
States have widely varying laws governing sales compensation. Non-compliance can result in:
• Wage claims and litigation by employees
• State labor department penalties and investigations
• Requirement to immediately pay disputed commissions
• Attorney's fees and penalty wages (2x or 3x in some states)
• Class action exposure for systemic violations
## 3.2 Key Areas of State Variation
States differ significantly on:
• Whether written commission agreements are required
• Timing of final commission payment upon termination
• Whether commissions can be subject to clawback
• Classification of commissions vs. bonuses
• Frequency of commission payments during employment
• Recordkeeping requirements
# 4. Definitions
Commission: Compensation earned as a percentage or amount based on sales transactions. Generally considered 'earned wages' under state law once the triggering event (sale, payment, delivery) occurs.
Bonus: Discretionary compensation not directly tied to specific sales. May be treated differently than commissions under state law.
Earned vs. Unearned: Critical distinction in many states. 'Earned' commissions must typically be paid on termination; 'unearned' commissions may be forfeited. States define 'earned' differently.
Final Pay: The last paycheck provided to a terminated employee, including all earned wages, accrued vacation (in some states), and earned commissions.
Deduction: Reduction from compensation. Many states restrict deductions from commission payments.
Waiting Time Penalties: Statutory penalties (e.g., one day of pay for each day payment is late) imposed by some states when final pay is not timely provided.
# 5. California Labor Code Requirements
California has the most extensive and employee-friendly commission laws in the country. Given Henry Schein's significant California operations, California compliance is critical.
## 5.1 Written Commission Agreement Requirement (Labor Code § 2751)
California REQUIRES a written commission agreement signed by both employer and employee that includes:
• Method of computing commissions
• When commissions are 'earned' (vesting trigger)
• Payment frequency during employment
• Treatment upon termination
Requirements:
• Must be signed before employee earns any commissions
• Employee must receive copy of signed agreement
• Any modifications must be in writing and signed
• Failure to have written agreement creates presumption in employee's favor in disputes
## 5.2 Final Payment Timing (Labor Code §§ 201-202)
California has strict final payment deadlines:
Involuntary Termination:
• All earned wages (including commissions) due immediately at termination
• 'Immediately' means at time of termination meeting
• Can mail if employee doesn't return to pick up (postmarked within 24 hours)
Voluntary Resignation:
• All earned wages due within 72 hours
• If employee gives 72+ hours notice, due on last day of work
Commission Specifics:
• Only 'earned' commissions must be paid immediately
• Commission agreement defines when commissions are 'earned'
• If commission not yet calculable, must estimate and pay within reasonable time
• Waiting time penalties apply if payment is late (up to 30 days of pay)
## 5.3 Clawback Restrictions
California significantly restricts commission clawbacks:
• Cannot deduct from final pay without employee's written authorization
• Cannot require repayment of earned commissions (except for advances or draws)
• 'Earned' commissions generally cannot be clawed back for returns/cancellations
• Commission agreement must clearly define when commissions vest (become 'earned')
## 5.4 Recordkeeping (Labor Code § 226)
California requires detailed recordkeeping:
• Itemized wage statements showing all compensation components
• Commission calculations must be accessible to employees
• Records retained for 4 years
• Employees have right to inspect/copy payroll records
• Penalties for inaccurate wage statements: $50 first violation, $100 each subsequent (up to $4,000)
# 6. Key Multi-State Requirements
## 6.1 Written Agreement Requirements by State
| State | Written Commission Agreement Requirement |
| California | REQUIRED - Must be signed before commissions earned (Labor Code § 2751) |
| Illinois | RECOMMENDED - Not statutorily required but highly advisable for disputes |
| New York | RECOMMENDED - Not required by Labor Law but important for enforceability |
| Massachusetts | REQUIRED for commissioned employees (M.G.L. c. 149, § 148C) |
| Washington | RECOMMENDED - Not required but protects employer in disputes |

## 6.2 Final Payment Timing by State
| State | Involuntary Termination | Voluntary Resignation |
| California | Immediately | 72 hours (or last day if notice given) |
| Illinois | Next scheduled payday | Next scheduled payday |
| New York | Next scheduled payday | Next scheduled payday |
| Massachusetts | Day of termination (commissions within reasonable time) | Next scheduled payday or within reasonable time |
| Washington | End of pay period | End of pay period |
| Colorado | Immediately | Next scheduled payday |
| Arizona | 3 days or next payday | Next scheduled payday |
| Texas | 6 days | Next scheduled payday |
| Florida | Next scheduled payday | Next scheduled payday |
| Pennsylvania | Next scheduled payday | Next scheduled payday |

## 6.3 Commission vs. Bonus Classification
Many states distinguish between commissions and bonuses for legal purposes:
Commission:
• Earned based on specific, measurable sales activities
• Non-discretionary (employee earns by meeting defined criteria)
• Generally must be paid on termination if 'earned'
• Subject to stricter state law requirements
Bonus:
• Discretionary payment not tied to specific formula
• Employer retains discretion on amount and payment
• May not be due on termination depending on plan terms
• Generally more flexibility in plan design
Henry Schein Approach:
Most Henry Schein sales incentive plans are commissions (non-discretionary, formula-based), not bonuses. Plans should be designed and documented as commissions with clear earning criteria to avoid disputes.
# 7. Commission Agreement Standards

• Include commissions pending from prior periods if 'earned'
Unearned Commissions:
• Identify transactions not yet meeting 'earned' criteria
• Apply plan terms regarding forfeiture or future payment
• Document basis for excluding from final pay
Estimates:
• If exact calculation not possible by final pay deadline, estimate conservatively (high)
• True-up within 30 days
• Document estimation methodology
## 8.3 Final Pay Processing by State
California:
• Involuntary: Process check for pickup at termination meeting or mail immediately
• Voluntary: Process within 72 hours (or last day if notice given)
• Include all earned commissions even if not yet calculated (estimate if needed)
All Other States:
• Follow state-specific timing requirements (see Section 6.2)
• Include earned commissions per plan terms
• Document compliance with applicable state law
# 9. Required Disclosures and Acknowledgments

# 11. Compliance Monitoring and Audits
## 11.1 Quarterly Compliance Checklist
Sales Compensation and HR conduct quarterly review:
• All active commissioned employees have signed commission agreements on file
• California agreements comply with Labor Code § 2751 requirements
• Commission payments processed within required timeframes
• Final payments for terminated employees met state deadlines
• No waiting time penalty situations identified
## 11.2 Annual State Law Update Review
Legal department conducts annual review of:
• State wage law changes affecting sales compensation
• New states where Henry Schein has commissioned employees
• Court decisions impacting commission law
• Needed policy or plan document updates
## 11.3 High-Risk State Focus
California operations receive enhanced monitoring:
• Monthly review of California terminations for final pay compliance
• Verification all California employees have Labor Code § 2751 compliant agreements
• Quarterly training for California HR and payroll staff
• Annual legal audit of California commission practices
# 12. Examples and Scenarios
## Example 1: California Involuntary Termination
California-based Sales Rep terminated (involuntary) on June 15. Has $15,000 in earned commissions from Q2 sales. Even though normal commission payment date is July 30, all earned commissions must be included in final check provided at termination meeting on June 15. Failure to include commissions in final check exposes Henry Schein to waiting time penalties of up to 30 days of wages (potentially $50K+).
## Example 2: Illinois Voluntary Resignation
Illinois-based Sales Rep resigns, giving 3 weeks notice, last day July 15. Illinois requires final pay by next scheduled payday. Since rep is paid monthly on last day of month, final pay (including earned commissions) due July 31. No penalty for paying on regular schedule. Best practice: process earlier if administratively feasible.
## Example 3: Missing Commission Agreement - California
California Sales Rep never signed commission agreement (oversight during hiring). Rep disputes commission calculation after termination. Because no written agreement exists, California law presumes interpretation most favorable to employee. Henry Schein must immediately obtain signed agreement for all California reps or face significant litigation risk.
## Example 4: Clawback Attempt - California
California-based Rep paid $20K commission in Q1 on deal that cancelled in Q2. Commission agreement states 'commissions earned upon customer payment.' Deal never paid. Company can offset future commissions against overpayment BUT cannot deduct from final paycheck without employee's written authorization. If rep refuses authorization, may need to pursue as civil debt collection.
