# 1. Purpose
This policy establishes governance standards for Sales Performance Incentive Funds (SPIFs), sales contests, and short-term promotional incentive programs at Henry Schein. The policy ensures SPIFs are strategically aligned, financially controlled, do not conflict with base compensation plans, and comply with legal and regulatory requirements.
# 2. Scope
This policy applies to:
• All short-term incentive programs with duration less than one fiscal year
• Product-specific, customer segment, or activity-based SPIFs
• Sales contests with monetary or non-monetary awards
• All divisions, business units, and sales roles within Henry Schein
This policy does NOT apply to annual compensation plans, recognition programs without incentive compensation, or employee referral bonuses.
# 3. Definitions
SPIF (Sales Performance Incentive Fund): A short-term incentive program designed to drive specific sales behaviors, product sales, or strategic initiatives over a limited time period (typically 1-12 weeks).
Sales Contest: A competitive program where participants compete against each other for awards based on relative performance rankings.
Overlay Program: An incentive program that runs concurrently with base compensation plans, providing incremental rewards for specified activities or outcomes.
Base Compensation Plan: The primary annual or ongoing commission/bonus plan that defines core compensation structure.
Conflict: A situation where a SPIF creates perverse incentives that contradict or undermine base plan objectives.
ROI (Return on Investment): The financial return generated by a SPIF relative to its total cost, calculated as incremental profit divided by program cost.
# 4. SPIF Approval Thresholds and Authority
SPIF approval requirements are based on total program cost and potential business impact:
| Total SPIF Budget | Approval Authority | Additional Review | Lead Time Required |
| Under $10,000 | Sales Manager + Sales Comp Manager | None | 2 weeks |
| $10,000 - $50,000 | Regional VP + Director Sales Comp | Finance review | 3 weeks |
| $50,000 - $150,000 | SVP Sales + VP Sales Comp + Finance | Legal review | 4 weeks |
| $150,000 - $500,000 | SVP Sales + CFO + Comp Review Board | Full business case | 6 weeks |
| Over $500,000 | CEO + CFO + Comp Review Board | Board notification | 8 weeks |

# 5. SPIF Design Standards

• Programs exceeding 12 weeks must be incorporated into base compensation plans
## 5.2 Eligibility Standards
• Clearly defined eligible population
• Must be open to all reps in defined segment (no selective participation)
• Eligibility criteria must be objective and measurable
• New hires within 90 days may be excluded or given prorated targets
## 5.3 Performance Measures
SPIFs must have clear, measurable performance criteria:
• Specific products, services, or customer segments
• Measurable outcomes (revenue, units, new customers, activities)
• Unambiguous definitions (no subjective assessment)
• System-trackable metrics preferred
## 5.4 Payout Structure
Acceptable payout structures include:

• Total program budget must include worst-case scenario
## 5.5 Communication Requirements
Every SPIF must include:
• Written program rules and guidelines
• Start and end dates (specific dates, not 'one month')
• Eligibility criteria
• Performance measures and tracking methodology
• Payout calculations with examples
• Payment timing
• Program administrator contact information
# 6. Budget Limits and Financial Controls
## 6.1 Individual Participation Limits
Total SPIF earnings for any individual sales rep are capped at:
• 25% of annual base compensation per quarter
• 50% of annual target incentive per fiscal year
Earnings exceeding these caps require Compensation Review Board approval.
## 6.2 Aggregate Budget Controls
• Total SPIF spending across all programs: Not to exceed 5% of total sales compensation budget
• Division-level SPIF budgets approved annually by Finance
• Monthly SPIF spending reports to Finance
• Budget overruns require SVP Sales and CFO approval
## 6.3 Vendor-Funded SPIFs
SPIFs funded by manufacturers or vendors are subject to this policy:
• Must be approved through same governance process
• Vendor funding does not bypass approval requirements
• Legal review required for all vendor-funded programs >$25K
• Must comply with anti-kickback and transparency regulations
• Vendor relationship must be disclosed to participants
# 7. ROI Measurement Requirements
## 7.1 Pre-Program ROI Projection
All SPIFs over $50,000 must include projected ROI analysis:
• Baseline performance (historical sales without SPIF)
• Projected incremental sales
• Incremental gross profit calculation
• Total program cost (awards + administration)
• Expected ROI percentage (Target: Minimum 3:1)
## 7.2 Post-Program ROI Analysis
Within 45 days of program completion, program owner must provide:
• Actual vs. projected sales performance
• Total awards paid
• Calculated incremental profit
• Actual ROI vs. projected
• Key learnings and recommendations
Programs failing to achieve 2:1 ROI require explanation and corrective action plan for future programs.
# 8. Conflict Avoidance with Base Compensation Plans
## 8.1 Prohibited Conflicts
SPIFs may NOT:
• Incentivize behavior that reduces base plan earnings
• Create incentive to defer sales to different time periods
• Encourage product mix that reduces overall profitability
• Contradict strategic objectives of base plans
• Create incentives to manipulate timing of order booking
## 8.2 Conflict Assessment Checklist
All SPIF proposals must address:
• How does this SPIF align with base plan objectives?
• Could reps earn more by gaming timing or product mix?
• Does this SPIF reward activities already compensated in base plans?
• What behaviors might be de-prioritized due to this SPIF?
• How will we measure if SPIF creates unintended consequences?
## 8.3 Stacking Limits
To prevent excessive layering of SPIFs:
• Maximum of 3 concurrent SPIFs per sales rep
• SPIFs on same product/customer segment must be additive, not duplicative
• Total potential SPIF earnings must be tracked against caps
# 9. Documentation and Tracking Requirements
## 9.1 SPIF Registration
All SPIFs must be registered in the central SPIF tracking system before launch:
• Program name and unique identifier
• Start and end dates
• Business sponsor and program administrator

• Program rules document reference
## 9.2 Participant Tracking

# 10. Payment Processing and Timing
## 10.1 Payment Timing Standards
• SPIFs under $50K total budget: Pay within 30 days of program end
• SPIFs over $50K: Pay within 45 days of program end (allows for verification)

## 10.3 Tax Treatment
All SPIF payments are taxable compensation subject to:
• Federal and state income tax withholding

# 11. Examples and Scenarios
## Example 1: Product Launch SPIF
Henry Schein launches new diagnostic equipment line. 8-week SPIF offers $500 per unit sold (max 10 units per rep). Budget: $75K. Eligible: 150 sales consultants. Approval: SVP Sales + VP Sales Comp + Finance. Result: 87 units sold, $43,500 paid, 3.2:1 ROI. Program deemed successful.
## Example 2: Customer Acquisition Contest
6-week contest for new customer acquisition. Top 10 reps win $5,000 each. Budget: $50K. Must be net new customers (not existing). Approval: Regional VP + Director Sales Comp + Finance. Result: 147 new customers added (baseline was 30), exceeded ROI target.
## Example 3: Rejected SPIF - Conflict with Base Plan
Proposed SPIF: $1,000 bonus for deals closed in last week of quarter. Rejected because: Creates incentive to hold deals and manipulate timing, contradicts base plan's quarterly attainment measures. Recommendation: Instead, increase commission rate on Q4 sales if needed to drive year-end performance.
