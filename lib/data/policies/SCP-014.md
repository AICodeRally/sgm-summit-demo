# CAP AND THRESHOLD GUIDELINES
## Sales Compensation Governance Policy
Document Owner: Compensation Lead Version: 1.0 Effective Date: January 1, 2026 Approved By: Compensation Review Board Last Updated: November 17, 2025 Next Review: January 1, 2027
## 1. PURPOSE
This policy establishes corporate guidelines for payout caps and performance thresholds in all sales incentive compensation plans, ensuring: - Financial predictability and budget management - Fairness and consistency across divisions - Prevention of windfall payouts - Motivation for minimum performance standards
## 2. SCOPE
Applies to all sales incentive compensation plans across all divisions unless explicitly exempted by the Compensation Review Board.
## 3. THRESHOLD GUIDELINES
### 3.1 Definition
Threshold: The minimum performance level required to earn any payout for a component or plan.
### 3.2 Corporate Guideline
Standard Threshold: 75% of quota - Performance below 75% of quota = $0 payout - Performance at 75% of quota = Minimum payout (typically 50-75% pro-rata credit) - Performance above 75% = Payout per plan curve
Rationale: - Ensures minimum performance standards - Aligns with market practices - Manages cost of low performance - Maintains focus on goal achievement
### 3.3 Threshold Variations by Role
| Role Type | Recommended Threshold | Rationale |
| Individual Contributors (IC) | 75% of quota | Standard expectation |
| Sales Managers | 80% of quota | Higher accountability |
| Executives | 80-90% of quota | Strategic leadership requirement |
| New Hires (first year) | 50-60% of quota | Ramp period accommodation |

### 3.4 Exceptions
Thresholds below 75% or above 90% require: - Written justification - Finance approval (budget impact) - Compensation Review Board approval
Exception Request Process: Submit Exception Request Form with: - Proposed threshold - Business rationale - Financial impact analysis - Risk assessment
## 4. CAP GUIDELINES
### 4.1 Definition
Cap (Maximum Payout): The maximum incentive payout regardless of performance level achieved.
### 4.2 Corporate Guideline - Individual Caps
Standard Individual Cap: 200% of Target Incentive
| Role Level | Standard Cap | Maximum Allowable Cap |
| Individual Contributor | 200% of TI | 250% of TI |
| Manager/Director | 175% of TI | 200% of TI |
| VP/Executive | 150% of TI | 175% of TI |

Rationale: - Budget predictability - Prevents excessive payouts from unusual events - Aligns with market practices - Manages shareholder/board concerns
### 4.3 Leverage Limits
Maximum Leverage: 3.0x base salary
Leverage Calculation:
Leverage = (Base Salary + Maximum Possible Incentive) / Base Salary
Example: - Base: $100,000 - Max Incentive (at 200% cap): $60,000 - Max Total Comp: $160,000 - Leverage: 1.6x ✓ (within 3.0x limit)
Plans exceeding 3.0x leverage require executive approval.
### 4.4 Performance-Based Caps
Attainment Cap:Some plans may cap credit at a maximum attainment level rather than dollar amount:
Example: - No credit for performance above 150% of quota - At 150% attainment → Maximum payout (200% of TI) - Performance above 150% → No additional payout
### 4.5 Budget Caps (Aggregate)
Division Budget Cap: Total incentive payout for a division may be capped at: - [X]% of division revenue - Absolute dollar budget limit
If division reaches budget cap: - Individual payouts may be reduced pro-rata - Payout curves may be adjusted - Next year planning may be reviewed
## 5. IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
### 5.1 Plan Documentation
All plan documents must: - Clearly state the threshold (if any) - Clearly state the cap (if any) - Explain the rationale for threshold and cap levels - Provide examples showing threshold and cap impact
### 5.2 Participant Communication
Plans with thresholds or caps must: - Clearly disclose in plan document - Include in participant communications - Provide worked examples - Answer FAQs about caps and thresholds
### 5.3 Manager Training
Sales managers must: - Understand cap and threshold guidelines - Be able to explain to their teams - Factor caps/thresholds into coaching and territory planning
## 6. GOVERNANCE & EXCEPTIONS
### 6.1 Approval Requirements
| Variance from Guideline | Approval Required |
| Threshold 70-75% | Compensation Manager |
| Threshold <70% or >80% | Comp Review Board |
| Cap 200-250% for IC | Finance + Comp Manager |
| Cap >250% for IC | Comp Review Board |
| Cap >200% for Manager+ | Comp Review Board |
| Leverage >3.0x | CFO + Comp Review Board |
| No cap | CFO + Comp Review Board (requires strong justification) |

### 6.2 Exception Criteria
Exceptions may be granted for: - New products/markets with high uncertainty - Turnaround situations - Recruitment/retention of key talent - Unique business circumstances - Ramp/transition periods
Required Documentation: - Business justification - Financial impact analysis - Risk assessment - Mitigation plans - Duration (temporary exceptions only)
## 7. MARKET BENCHMARKING
Annual Review: Caps and thresholds are benchmarked annually against: - Industry standards (medical/dental sales) - Role-specific market data - Peer company practices
Data Sources: - Compensation surveys (e.g., Radford, Mercer) - Industry associations - Consultant recommendations
Adjustment Process: - Review market data annually in Q4 - Propose updates to guidelines if needed - CRB approval of any changes - Implement for next plan year
## 8. MONITORING & REPORTING
### 8.1 Quarterly Reporting
Sales Operations reports quarterly on: - % of participants hitting caps - % of participants below threshold - Average payout % of TI - Budget impact of caps
### 8.2 Annual Analysis
Compensation conducts annual analysis of: - Effectiveness of cap levels (too many hitting cap = consider adjustment) - Threshold impact (too many below = quota/plan design issue) - Financial impact - Recommendations for next year
## 9. SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES
### 9.1 Windfalls
Even within cap limits, unusually large payouts (“windfalls”) may be reviewed.
Windfall Review Trigger: Individual payout >$[amount] OR >3x historical average
Review Process: - Finance + Compensation review circumstances - Determine if payout is earned vs. windfall (luck, one-time event, data error) - CRB may exercise discretion to adjust if windfall is unearned
See Windfall Policy for details.
### 9.2 New Products/Markets
Plans for new products or new markets may have: - Lower thresholds (or no threshold) during launch period - Higher caps to incentivize adoption - Sunset provisions (revert to standard guidelines after X months/years)
### 9.3 Guarantees & Draws
For new hires or roles with guarantees: - Guarantees do not count toward cap calculations - Once guarantee period ends, standard caps apply - Draw recoveries are not subject to caps

## APPENDIX A: CAP & THRESHOLD CALCULATION EXAMPLES
### Example 1: Standard IC Plan with Threshold and Cap
Plan Details: - Target Incentive: $40,000 - Threshold: 75% of quota - Cap: 200% of TI ($80,000) - Quota: $2,000,000
Scenario A: Below Threshold - Actual Performance: $1,400,000 - Attainment: 70% - Result: $0 payout (below 75% threshold)
Scenario B: At Target - Actual Performance: $2,000,000 - Attainment: 100% - Payout: $40,000 (100% of TI)
Scenario C: High Performance, Within Cap - Actual Performance: $3,000,000 - Attainment: 150% - Calculated Payout (with accelerator): $70,000 (175% of TI) - Actual Payout: $70,000 (within $80,000 cap)
Scenario D: Hitting Cap - Actual Performance: $3,500,000 - Attainment: 175% - Calculated Payout (with accelerator): $95,000 (237% of TI) - Actual Payout: $80,000 (capped at 200% of TI = $80,000)
## APPENDIX B: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
Q: Why do we have caps? A: Caps manage budget risk, prevent windfalls from unusual events, and align with market practices.
Q: What happens to performance above the cap? A: Performance above cap is recognized as excellent achievement but does not result in additional payout.
Q: Can caps be waived? A: Rarely. Waivers require executive approval and strong business justification.
Q: Why do we have thresholds? A: Thresholds ensure minimum performance standards and manage the cost of underperformance.
Q: What if I’m just below the threshold? A: Unfortunately, performance below threshold results in zero payout for that component/period. This emphasizes the importance of achieving minimum standards.
Q: Do thresholds apply to new hires? A: New hires may have reduced thresholds during their ramp period. Check your specific plan.
