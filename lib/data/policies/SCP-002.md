# 1. Purpose
This policy establishes a standardized framework for setting, managing, and adjusting sales quotas across Henry Schein. The policy ensures quotas are fair, achievable, aligned with business objectives, and consistently applied while providing appropriate governance over mid-year adjustments.
# 2. Scope
This policy applies to:
• All sales roles with defined quota targets
• All divisions and business units within Henry Schein
• Annual quota setting and mid-year quota adjustments
• Both individual and team-based quotas
# 3. Definitions
Quota: The sales target assigned to an individual, team, or territory representing expected performance over a defined period.
Base Quota: The initial quota assigned at the beginning of the performance period based on historical performance, territory potential, and business objectives.
Adjusted Quota: A quota that has been modified during the performance period due to qualifying circumstances as defined in this policy.
Quota Attainment: The percentage of quota achieved, calculated as actual results divided by assigned quota.
Territory Potential: The estimated total addressable market or revenue opportunity within a defined sales territory.
Quota Relief: A reduction in quota due to circumstances outside the sales representative's control.
Quota Capacity: The theoretical maximum sales that can be achieved given available resources and market conditions.
# 4. Quota Setting Principles and Methodology
## 4.1 Core Principles
Henry Schein's quota setting process is guided by these principles:
• Alignment: Quotas align with corporate financial goals and strategic objectives
• Fairness: Similar roles in similar territories receive comparable quota treatment
• Achievability: Quotas are challenging yet attainable with strong performance
• Transparency: Methodology and factors are clearly communicated
• Consistency: Similar situations are treated consistently across the organization
• Data-Driven: Quotas are based on objective data and analysis
## 4.2 Quota Setting Methodology
Quotas are established using a balanced approach that considers:
Historical Performance (40% weight):
• Prior 3-year average sales performance
• Year-over-year growth trends
• Seasonality patterns
Territory Potential (30% weight):
• Market size and penetration analysis
• Customer base size and growth potential
• Competitive landscape
• Geographic and demographic factors
Strategic Priorities (20% weight):
• Corporate growth targets
• Product/service mix objectives
• New market penetration goals
• Strategic account development
Resource Allocation (10% weight):
• Territory size and account count
• Support staff availability
• Marketing and lead generation support
## 4.3 Target Attainment Expectations
Quotas are set with the following attainment expectations:
• 50-60% of team: Expected to achieve 90-110% of quota (on-target performance)
• 20-25% of team: Expected to exceed 110% of quota (high performers)
• 15-25% of team: May achieve 70-90% of quota (developing or challenging territories)
• Overall team attainment target: 95-105% of aggregate quota
# 5. Annual Quota Setting Process
## 5.1 Timeline
The annual quota setting process follows this timeline:
| Timeframe | Activity |
| September | Finance provides corporate revenue targets to divisions |
| October | Divisional leadership allocates targets to territories |
| Early November | Sales Compensation develops preliminary quota recommendations |
| Mid-November | Review with Sales Leadership and Finance |
| Late November | Quota Review Board approval |
| Early December | Final executive approval |
| Mid-December | Quota communication to sales teams |
| January 1 | Quotas effective for new fiscal year |

## 5.2 Approval Requirements
Annual quotas require the following approvals:
• Territory/Individual Quotas: Regional Sales Manager
• Regional Aggregated Quotas: Divisional VP of Sales
• Divisional Quotas: SVP of Sales + CFO
• Corporate Consolidated Quotas: CEO + Board of Directors
# 6. Mid-Year Quota Adjustments
Mid-year quota adjustments are discouraged and require strong justification. This policy establishes clear triggers and approval thresholds for when adjustments may be considered.
## 6.1 Qualifying Triggers for Quota Adjustment
Quota adjustments may be approved only for the following circumstances:
Territory Changes:
• Significant addition or removal of accounts (>20% of territory)
• Geographic territory expansion or contraction
• Territory splits or mergers
Market Conditions:
• Major customer bankruptcy or business closure (>$1M impact)
• Regulatory changes affecting product availability
• Natural disaster or force majeure events
• Significant competitive displacement (documented loss of >15% territory value)
Internal Changes:
• Role change with different responsibilities
• Significant product line additions or discontinuations
• Corporate restructuring or acquisitions
• Extended leave of absence (>60 consecutive days)
Performance Period Changes:
• New hire starting mid-year (proration)
• Promotion or transfer (quota transition)
## 6.2 Non-Qualifying Reasons
Quota adjustments will NOT be approved for:
• Below-target performance or difficulty achieving quota
• General market softness affecting all territories equally
• Temporary sales slowdowns (<2 consecutive quarters)
• Personal circumstances unrelated to territory potential
• Desire to increase earnings potential
## 6.3 Adjustment Thresholds and Approval Levels
| Adjustment Size | Approval Authority | Required Documentation |
| Under 10% | Regional Sales Manager + Sales Comp Director | Justification memo + supporting data |
| 10-25% | VP of Sales + VP Sales Compensation + Finance | Business case + financial impact analysis |
| 25-50% | SVP Sales + CFO + Comp Review Board | Comprehensive analysis + executive justification |
| Over 50% | CEO + Comp Review Board | Full business case + alternative analysis |

## 6.4 Timing of Adjustments
Quota adjustments must be:
• Requested within 30 days of the triggering event
• Effective prospectively from the date of approval (no retroactive adjustments)
• Limited to once per quarter per individual (except for role changes)
• Finalized by the 15th of the month to take effect that same month
# 7. Territory Changes and Quota Impact
## 7.1 Territory Addition Quota Treatment
When accounts or geography are added to a territory:
• Quota increases proportionally based on historical performance of added accounts
• 90-day ramp period applied for new account familiarization
• Minimum addition threshold: Accounts representing >5% of current quota
## 7.2 Territory Reduction Quota Treatment
When accounts or geography are removed from a territory:
• Quota decreases based on trailing 12-month performance of removed accounts
• Adjustment is effective immediately upon account transfer
• In-flight opportunities may be retained if >50% sales cycle complete
## 7.3 Territory Split Methodology
When a territory is divided between multiple representatives:
• Total quota for split territories equals 100-105% of original quota
• Each new territory receives quota based on account distribution and historical performance
• 5% increase accounts for additional coverage and focus
# 8. New Business vs. Renewal/Retention Quotas
Different quota types may be established based on role responsibilities:
## 8.1 Hunter Roles (New Business Focus)
• 80-100% of quota from new customer acquisition
• Quota based on average deal size × expected close rate × number of opportunities
• Sales cycle length factored into quota calculations
## 8.2 Farmer Roles (Account Management Focus)
• 70-90% of quota from existing customer base
• Quota based on retention rate × growth targets
• Churn risk factored into quota setting
## 8.3 Hybrid Roles
• Split quotas: e.g., 60% retention + 40% new business
• Each component tracked and measured separately
• Separate attainment calculations for each quota component
# 9. Documentation Requirements
## 9.1 Quota Assignment Documentation
Each quota assignment must include:
• Individual or territory identifier
• Quota amount(s) by measure (revenue, GP, units, etc.)
• Performance period
• Account/territory scope
• Commission plan reference
• Approval signatures and dates
## 9.2 Quota Adjustment Request Form
All adjustment requests must include:
• Current quota and proposed new quota
• Percentage change
• Triggering event with dates and specifics
• Impact analysis (financial and performance)
• Supporting documentation (territory changes, market data, etc.)
• Year-to-date performance context

## 9.3 Quota Change Log
Sales Compensation maintains a comprehensive quota change log capturing all adjustments with:
• Employee name and ID
• Original quota
• Adjusted quota
• Change reason and category
• Approval chain
• Effective date
• Supporting documentation reference
# 10. Fairness Review and Appeals Process
## 10.1 Quota Fairness Review
Prior to finalizing annual quotas, Sales Compensation conducts a fairness analysis:
• Quota per account comparisons across similar territories
• Quota growth rate analysis (ensure consistency)
• Territory potential vs. quota alignment checks
• Outlier identification and justification
## 10.2 Quota Appeal Process
Sales representatives may appeal their annual quota assignment:
Step 1: Initial Review with Manager
• Rep discusses concerns with direct manager within 15 days of quota notification
• Manager reviews data and may submit adjustment request if warranted
Step 2: Formal Appeal
• If unsatisfied, rep submits written appeal to Sales Compensation within 30 days
• Appeal must include specific data-driven rationale
• Sales Compensation reviews with Finance and Regional VP
Step 3: Final Review
• Unresolved appeals escalate to Quota Review Committee
• Committee decision is final
• Decision communicated within 15 business days
# 11. Examples and Scenarios
## Example 1: Territory Account Addition
Sales Rep has $2M annual quota. In Q2, she receives 10 new accounts with combined historical revenue of $600K. Her quota is increased by $540K (90% of historical performance due to familiarization period), effective June 1. New quota: $2.54M. Approval: Regional Manager + Sales Comp Director.
## Example 2: Mid-Year Territory Reduction
Sales Rep has $3M quota. Company restructures territories and removes accounts representing $900K in trailing 12-month revenue. Quota reduced by $900K to $2.1M effective immediately. This is a 30% reduction, requiring SVP + CFO + Comp Review Board approval.
## Example 3: Major Customer Loss
Sales Rep loses largest customer ($1.2M annual revenue) due to bankruptcy. Rep requests quota reduction. Since customer loss is beyond rep's control and represents >15% of territory, a quota adjustment is approved reducing quota from $4M to $3.2M (20% reduction). Approval: VP Sales + VP Sales Comp + Finance.
## Example 4: Non-Qualifying Adjustment Request
Sales Rep is at 65% of quota through Q3 and requests a reduction due to 'challenging market conditions.' Analysis shows other reps in similar territories are performing at 95%+ attainment. Request is denied as general market conditions and below-target performance are not qualifying triggers.
