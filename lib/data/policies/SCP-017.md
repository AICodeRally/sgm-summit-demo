# International Requirements Policy

**Policy Code:** SCP-017
**Category:** Legal Compliance
**Framework Area:** International Requirements
**Status:** TEMPLATE
**Legal Review Required:** No

---

## PURPOSE

This policy establishes the framework for adapting Henry Schein's US-based compensation plans to international jurisdictions. It mandates that all international compensation arrangements undergo local legal review and compliance verification before implementation, ensuring adherence to country-specific employment laws, tax regulations, data privacy requirements, and labor standards.

---

## SCOPE

This policy applies to:
- All Henry Schein sales compensation plans implemented outside the United States
- All sales representatives employed in international markets
- Expatriate assignments involving compensation plan administration
- Third-party sales agents and representatives in foreign jurisdictions
- All divisions and business units operating internationally

---

## DEFINITIONS

**Home Country:** The country where Henry Schein maintains its primary legal entity and where the employee's employment contract originates.

**Host Country:** The country where the employee physically works and where local employment laws apply.

**Local Legal Review:** Examination of compensation plan terms by qualified employment counsel licensed to practice law in the host country, specifically assessing compliance with local labor laws, tax regulations, and employment standards.

**Split Payroll:** Compensation arrangement where portions of an employee's pay are processed through different country payrolls to manage tax obligations, social security contributions, and compliance requirements across jurisdictions.

**US Plan Baseline:** The standard Henry Schein US compensation plan structure (e.g., SCP-001 through SCP-016) used as the starting template for international adaptation.

**Expatriate (Expat):** Employee transferred from their home country to work in a host country, typically maintaining home-country employment contract with host-country supplements.

**Local National:** Employee hired directly in the host country under local employment contract and terms.

**Third-Country National (TCN):** Employee from one country working in a second country for a company headquartered in a third country.

---

## POLICY PRINCIPLES

### Principle 1: US Plans as Baseline Reference

All Henry Schein international compensation plans shall use the corresponding US plan as the structural baseline. This ensures:
- Consistency in plan philosophy and objectives
- Alignment with corporate compensation strategy
- Shared terminology and plan components
- Streamlined administration and communication

**Example:** When implementing a sales compensation plan in Germany, start with the applicable US plan (e.g., SCP-001 Clawback Policy, SCP-007 Sales Crediting Policy) and adapt as required for German labor law.

### Principle 2: Local Legal Review Mandatory

**No exceptions.** Every international compensation plan or plan modification must undergo review by qualified local employment counsel before implementation. This is not optional.

### Principle 3: Compliance Over Consistency

When local law conflicts with US plan terms, **local law always prevails**. Henry Schein prioritizes legal compliance over administrative convenience or global consistency.

### Principle 4: Document All Adaptations

Every deviation from the US baseline plan must be:
- Documented in writing
- Approved by local legal counsel
- Reviewed by Global HR and Finance
- Maintained in the plan governance repository
