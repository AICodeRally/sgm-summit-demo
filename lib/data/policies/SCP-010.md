# MID-PERIOD CHANGE POLICY
## Managing Plan, Quota, and Participant Changes During Active Performance Periods
Document Owner: Compensation Manager Version: 1.0 Effective Date: January 1, 2026 Last Updated: November 19, 2025 Next Review: Annual (January 2027)
## 1. PURPOSE
Establish guidelines for handling changes to compensation plans, quotas, and participant circumstances that occur during an active performance period to ensure: - Fairness to affected participants - Business flexibility when needed - Clear approval requirements - Proper calculation and pro-ration - Minimization of mid-period changes (encourage planning)
## 2. SCOPE
Applies to all changes occurring after a performance period has begun: - Plan design changes (measures, formulas, caps, thresholds) - Quota changes (increases or decreases) - Participant status changes (promotions, demotions, transfers, leaves) - Territory changes - Organizational changes (mergers, acquisitions, restructuring)
## 3. GUIDING PRINCIPLES
### 3.1 Stability Principle
Compensation plans should be stable and predictable. - Plans designed and approved before period begins - Mid-period changes minimized - Changes made only when necessary for business reasons
### 3.2 No Retroactive Changes (General Rule)
Do not change the rules after performance has occurred. - Changes apply prospectively (from change date forward) - Exception: Correcting company errors (may apply retroactively)
### 3.3 Participant Protection
Changes should not unfairly penalize participants. - If change reduces earnings potential, consider grandfathering or phase-in - If change due to company action (reorg, etc.), participant should be made whole
### 3.4 Clear Communication
All changes must be clearly communicated in advance. - Explain what’s changing and why - Explain impact on participant - Provide transition plan
## 4. TYPES OF MID-PERIOD CHANGES
### 4.1 Plan Design Changes
Definition: Changes to plan structure, measures, formulas, caps, thresholds, or other plan terms
Policy: STRONGLY DISCOURAGED
Rationale: - Undermines trust - Creates confusion - May be perceived as “changing the rules mid-game” - Difficult to administer
When Permitted: - Legal/regulatory requirement (must change to comply with law) - Significant business change (acquisition, product line discontinuation, etc.) - Plan error that is unsustainable (e.g., calculation error causing massive overpayment)
Approval Required: CRB (always)
Participant Impact: - If change reduces earnings potential, consider: - Grandfathering current participants (apply change to new hires only) - Phase-in over multiple periods - One-time transition payment to offset impact
### 4.2 Quota Changes
Definition: Changing individual quota assignment mid-period
Policy: DISCOURAGED but more common than plan design changes
Permitted Reasons: - Territory change (see Territory Change Procedures) - Promotion or role change - Organizational restructuring - Significant business change (lost major customer, gained major account) - Correction of error (quota set incorrectly)
NOT Permitted: - Performance-based (participant underperforming, so lower quota to make easier) ❌ - Favoritism or inequity - Retroactive change without justification
Approval Required: - <10% change: Sales Operations Manager - 10-25% change: Sales Manager + Compensation Manager - >25% change: Sales VP + Compensation Manager + CRB (if decrease)
Participant Impact: - Pro-rate quota for period (see Section 6) - Communicate change clearly - Document justification
### 4.3 Participant Status Changes
Common Scenarios: - Promotion - Demotion - Transfer to different role/division - Leave of absence - Return from leave
Policy: Handled per specific policies (see cross-references)
Cross-References: - Promotion/Transfer: See Section 5.3 below - Leave of Absence: See Leave of Absence Policy - Termination: See Termination Policy
### 4.4 Territory Changes
Definition: Reassigning territory ownership mid-period
Policy: See Territory Change Procedures (separate document)
Summary: - Quota pro-rated - In-flight deals credited per crediting rules - Manager approval required
### 4.5 Organizational Changes
Examples: - Merger or acquisition - Division reorganization - Product line discontinuation - Geographic expansion/contraction
Policy: Case-by-case basis
Approach: 1. Assess impact on participants 2. Develop transition plan 3. Communicate transparently 4. Make participants whole (if change due to company action) 5. CRB approval for plan changes
## 5. SPECIFIC CHANGE SCENARIOS
### 5.1 Mid-Period Quota Increase
Scenario: Business opportunity increased; need to raise quota
Approach: - Option A: Increase quota pro-rated for remaining period ``` Original Annual Quota: $1,000,000 Change Date: July 1 (mid-year)
Quota Jan-June: $500,000 (50% of year) New Quota Jul-Dec: Increased to $600,000 (reflect new opportunity)
Blended Annual Quota: $500,000 + $600,000 = $1,100,000 ```
Option B: Provide stretch goal with accelerator (rather than raise base quota)
Keeps base quota stable
Rewards extra performance with accelerator
Easier to communicate
Recommendation: Option B (stretch goal) preferred over mid-period quota increase.
Approval: Sales Manager + Compensation Manager
### 5.2 Mid-Period Quota Decrease
Scenario: Territory reduced, major customer lost, role scope decreased
Approach: - Pro-rate quota for remaining period ``` Original Annual Quota: $1,000,000 Change Date: July 1
Quota Jan-June: $500,000 (50% of year) New Quota Jul-Dec: Reduced to $400,000 (reflect reduced territory)
Blended Annual Quota: $500,000 + $400,000 = $900,000 ```
Approval: Sales VP + Compensation Manager + CRB (if decrease >25%)
Rationale for High Approval: - Quota decreases can be perceived as “making it easier” - Must ensure decrease is justified (territory actually reduced, not helping underperformer) - Document evidence of scope reduction
Communication: Must clearly explain why quota decreased (territory change, customer loss, etc.).
### 5.3 Promotion or Role Change
Scenario: Employee promoted mid-year to new role with different compensation plan
Approach:
Option A: Immediate Transition - Effective promotion date, switch to new plan - Old plan: Pro-rated for time in old role - New plan: Pro-rated for time in new role - Two separate calculations; two separate payments
Example:
Employee promoted July 1 from Field Sales to Sales Manager

Old Plan (Field Sales):
- Jan-June performance: Calculate payout per old plan
- Pay in Q3 (per old plan schedule)

New Plan (Sales Manager):
- July-Dec performance: Calculate payout per new plan
- Pay per new plan schedule

Result: Employee participates in both plans for partial year
Option B: Deferred Transition - Complete current period on old plan - Start new plan at beginning of next period (e.g., next quarter or next year)
Recommendation: Option A (immediate transition) for promotions; Option B for convenience if promotion occurs late in period.
Approval: Sales Manager + HR
Communication: - Congratulate employee on promotion - Explain compensation transition - Provide written summary of old plan payout (if any) and new plan terms
### 5.4 Organizational Restructuring
Scenario: Division reorganization affects multiple participants
Approach: 1. Assess Impact: - How many participants affected? - Nature of change (territory, quota, plan, all of above?) - Projected financial impact
Develop Transition Plan:
Will quotas change? (Pro-rate per Section 6)
Will territories change? (Follow Territory Change Procedures)
Will plan design change? (Requires CRB approval)
Grandfathering Consideration:
If change disadvantages current participants, consider grandfathering
Example: New plan has less favorable terms → Current participants stay on old plan until year-end; new hires get new plan
Communication Plan:
Town hall or team meetings to explain restructuring
Individual meetings with affected participants
Written summary of changes and impact
Q&A support
CRB Approval:
For plan changes
For major organizational comp impacts
## 6. QUOTA PRO-RATION METHODOLOGY
### 6.1 Standard Pro-Ration Formula
For mid-period quota changes:
Blended Annual Quota = (Old Quota × % of Year in Old Quota) + (New Quota × % of Year in New Quota)
Example:
Original Annual Quota: $1,200,000
Change Date: April 1 (start of Q2)
New Annual Quota (if full year): $1,500,000

Time in Old Quota: Jan 1 - Mar 31 = 90 days (24.7% of year)
Time in New Quota: Apr 1 - Dec 31 = 275 days (75.3% of year)

Blended Quota:
= ($1,200,000 × 0.247) + ($1,500,000 × 0.753)
= $296,400 + $1,129,500
= $1,425,900

Employee's quota for year-end attainment calculation: $1,425,900
### 6.2 Monthly vs. Annual Plans
Monthly Plans: - If quota changes mid-month, pro-rate that month - Subsequent months use new quota
Example:
Monthly quota: $100,000
Change on Mar 15 (mid-month)
March has 31 days; change on day 15

March quota = (Old quota × 14/31) + (New quota × 17/31)
Annual Plans: - Pro-rate as shown in Section 6.1 (based on days in year)

Minimum Notice: - Plan design changes: 30 days - Quota changes: 15 days - Territory changes: 10 days (or as soon as known)
Exception: Emergency changes (legal requirement, urgent business need) may have shorter notice, but must communicate as soon as possible.
### 8.2 What to Communicate
For any mid-period change, communicate: 1. What is changing: Plan, quota, territory, etc. 2. Why: Business rationale 3. When: Effective date 4. Impact: How this affects the participant (calculation examples) 5. Transition: What happens between now and effective date 6. Questions: Who to contact
### 8.3 Communication Methods
Individual Changes (1-10 people): - One-on-one meeting (manager + participant) - Followed by written confirmation (email)
Group Changes (>10 people): - Team meeting or town hall - Individual follow-up for complex situations - Written FAQ - Office hours for questions
## 9. DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
For all mid-period changes, document: - [ ] Change request form or memo - [ ] Business justification - [ ] Impact analysis (# of participants, financial impact) - [ ] Approval(s) obtained - [ ] Communication to affected participants - [ ] Participant acknowledgment (if significant change) - [ ] System updates (ICMT, CRM)
Retention: 7 years per Data Retention Policy
## 10. PARTICIPANT ACKNOWLEDGMENT
When Required: - Plan design changes affecting participant’s plan - Quota changes >25% - Role changes (promotion, demotion, transfer)
Method: - Update plan document or create addendum - Participant reviews and signs - File in participant file
Template: See Plan Acknowledgment Form
## 11. SYSTEM UPDATES
Sales Operations must update: - ICMT: Quota, plan assignment, participant status - CRM: Territory assignments - Documentation: Change log, participant file
Timing: Complete system updates before effective date (ideally 5 business days prior).
## 12. DISPUTE RESOLUTION
If participant disagrees with mid-period change: - Follow Dispute Resolution Procedures - Common disputes: - “Quota change is unfair” - “Change wasn’t communicated properly” - “I didn’t agree to this”
Resolution: - If change was properly approved and communicated, change stands - If error in process (e.g., insufficient notice), may delay effective date - If participant has valid concern, escalate to CRB
## 13. BEST PRACTICES
### 13.1 Minimize Mid-Period Changes
Strategies: - Thorough planning before period begins - Annual planning process (quota setting, territory design, plan design) - Buffer in plans for expected changes (e.g., ramping quota for new hires)
### 13.2 Grandfather When Possible
If change is disadvantageous to current participants: - Consider applying change to new hires or new period only - Current participants continue on old terms until natural transition point
Example:
Company wants to reduce cap from 200% to 150%
Instead of mid-year change:
- Current participants: Cap remains 200% through end of year
- New hires starting next year: Cap is 150%
- All participants: Cap is 150% starting next year
### 13.3 Phase-In Major Changes
For significant changes: - Phase in over multiple periods (e.g., 3 quarters) - Reduces shock - Allows participants to adapt
Example:
Plan redesign will reduce average payout by 20%
Instead of immediate change:
- Q1: 90% of old plan payout (10% reduction)
- Q2: 85% of old plan payout (15% reduction)
- Q3: 80% of old plan payout (20% reduction)
- Q4+: New plan (full reduction)
## 14. LEGAL & COMPLIANCE CONSIDERATIONS
### 14.1 Contract Law
Employment Contracts: - If participant has employment contract guaranteeing comp terms, cannot change without consent or per contract terms - Consult Legal before changing terms for contracted employees
At-Will Employment: - Most participants are at-will; company retains right to change comp plans - However, must communicate changes and apply fairly
### 14.2 Wage Laws
State Laws Vary: - Some states restrict mid-period changes to commission plans - California: Limitations on retroactive changes - Consult Legal for state-specific requirements
### 14.3 Discrimination
Ensure changes are: - Applied consistently - Based on legitimate business reasons - Not discriminatory (age, race, gender, etc.)
