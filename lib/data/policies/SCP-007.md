# SALES CREDITING POLICY
## Performance Attribution and Credit Rules
Document Owner: Sales Operations Manager Version: 1.0 Effective Date: January 1, 2026 Last Updated: November 19, 2025 Next Review: Annual (January 2027)
## 1. PURPOSE
Establish clear, consistent rules for crediting sales performance to ensure: - Fair attribution of sales to appropriate sales representatives - Transparency and predictability - Dispute minimization - Data integrity - Support for business objectives (collaboration, customer focus)
## 2. SCOPE
Applies to all sales performance tracked for incentive compensation purposes: - Revenue (bookings, billings) - Orders - Units sold - New customer acquisition - Other performance measures per plan documents
## 3. CORE CREDITING PRINCIPLES
### 3.1 Territory-Based Crediting (Primary Rule)
General Rule: Credit goes to the sales representative assigned to the customer’s territory at the time of sale.
Rationale: - Clear ownership and accountability - Encourages territory management - Minimizes disputes
Determining Territory: - Based on customer location (billing address, shipping address, or designated office) - Territory assignments documented in CRM (Salesforce) - Territory maps maintained by Sales Operations
### 3.2 Closed Date Determines Credit
General Rule: Performance is credited based on when the transaction is officially closed/booked.
For Revenue: - Close Date = Date order is booked in ERP system or contract is signed (whichever represents commitment)
For Orders: - Close Date = Date purchase order received or contract signed
Example:
Rep A assigned to Territory X: Jan 1 - June 30
Rep B assigned to Territory X: July 1 - Dec 31

Deal in Territory X closes July 5 → Credit to Rep B
Deal in Territory X closes June 28 → Credit to Rep A
### 3.3 One Transaction, One Credit (No Double-Dipping)
General Rule: Each transaction is credited only once (100% to one rep or split among multiple reps totaling 100%).
Exception: Overlay/Specialist roles may receive separate credit (see Section 7).
## 4. STANDARD CREDITING SCENARIOS
### 4.1 Standard Sale (Single Rep)
Scenario: Rep in assigned territory closes deal
Crediting: - 100% credit to assigned territory rep
Example:
Customer ABC located in Territory 5
Territory 5 assigned to Jane Smith
Jane closes $100K deal with Customer ABC

Credit: Jane Smith = $100,000
### 4.2 New Customer vs. Existing Customer
Crediting Rule: Same - credit to assigned territory rep
Exception - New Customer Bonus: - If plan includes new customer acquisition bonus, rep receives bonus for first sale to new customer - Subsequent sales to same customer credited normally (no repeat bonus)
### 4.3 Repeat/Renewal Business
Crediting: Current territory owner receives credit, even if prior rep established relationship
Rationale: Encourages ongoing customer relationship management
Example:
Rep A sold to Customer ABC in 2025 (initial sale)
Rep B now owns territory where Customer ABC located (2026)
Customer ABC places new order in 2026

Credit for 2026 order: Rep B (current owner)
### 4.4 Customer Relocates
Crediting: Credit to territory where customer is located at time of sale
Example:
Customer ABC located in Territory 5 (Rep A) on Jan 1
Customer ABC relocates to Territory 10 (Rep B) on March 1
Customer ABC places order on April 15

Credit: Rep B (customer's current territory)
Note: If customer relocates mid-sales cycle and deal was substantially developed by Rep A, may split credit (see Section 5).
## 5. SPLIT CREDIT SCENARIOS
### 5.1 Team Selling (Planned Collaboration)
Scenario: Two or more reps collaborate on sale
Standard Split: - 50/50 split if two reps collaborate equally - Other splits (60/40, 70/30, etc.) if contribution differs
Requirements for Split Credit: - ☐ Both reps documented in CRM opportunity (before close) - ☐ Split percentage agreed in advance (documented in CRM) - ☐ Manager approval (if not pre-approved split rule)
Example:
Customer spans two territories (multi-location)
Rep A (Territory 5) and Rep B (Territory 10) collaborate
Agreed split: 50/50
Deal closes for $200,000

Credit: Rep A = $100,000, Rep B = $100,000
### 5.2 Territory Transition (Mid-Sales Cycle)
Scenario: Territory reassigned while deal is in progress
Crediting Rules:
| Deal Stage at Transition | Crediting |
| Early (Qualified, Discovery) | 100% to new rep (must close it) |
| Mid (Proposal, Negotiation) | 50/50 split OR 100% to new rep (manager decides) |
| Late (Verbal Commit, Contract Pending) | 100% to old rep if closes within 30 days; otherwise 50/50 |

Documentation Required: - Deal stage documented in CRM at time of transition - Manager approval of credit allocation - Notification to both reps
Example:
Rep A owns Territory X Jan-June
Rep B takes over Territory X July 1
Deal with Customer in Territory X is at "Proposal" stage on July 1
Deal closes Aug 15

Manager Decision: 50/50 split (both reps contributed)
Deal value: $100,000
Credit: Rep A = $50,000, Rep B = $50,000
### 5.3 House Accounts / National Accounts
Scenario: Account managed at corporate level, but local rep supports
Standard Treatment: - National Account Manager (NAM): Receives primary credit (e.g., 70-80%) - Local Territory Rep: Receives support credit (e.g., 20-30%) - Split defined in advance for each house account
Documentation: - House account list maintained by Sales Operations - Split percentages documented - Updated annually or when accounts change
### 5.4 Channel/Partner Sales
Scenario: Sale facilitated by channel partner, but territory rep supports
Crediting Options:
Option A: Channel sales credited to territory rep (encourages partner enablement) - Rep receives credit as if direct sale
Option B: Reduced credit for channel sales - Rep receives 50-75% credit (reflecting lower effort)
Policy: [Company selects Option A or B and documents here]
For Henry Schein: Option A - Full credit to territory rep for channel sales in their territory.
## 6. SPECIAL SITUATIONS
### 6.1 Online/E-Commerce Sales
Scenario: Customer purchases via website or e-commerce platform
Crediting: - Credit to territory rep assigned to customer’s location - If customer not previously assigned, use billing/shipping address to determine territory
Rationale: Territory rep still responsible for customer relationship, even if purchase is self-service.
### 6.2 Inside Sales / BDR Support
Scenario: Inside sales or BDR generates lead; field rep closes deal
Crediting: - Field Rep: Receives full credit for revenue/order - Inside Sales/BDR: May receive separate credit/bonus for qualified lead (if plan includes lead generation bonus)
No Split: Field rep and inside sales on different plans; not split.
### 6.3 Customer Service / Account Manager Orders
Scenario: Customer places routine order with customer service (not sales rep)
Crediting: - Credit to assigned territory rep - Customer service not commissioned on sales
Exception: If customer service on sales incentive plan, may receive credit per their plan terms.
### 6.4 Demo/Loaner/Internal Use Equipment
Scenario: Product provided as demo, loaner, or for internal company use
Crediting: - No Credit: Demo units, loaners, and internal use do not count toward sales quota - Exception: If demo converts to sale, then credit per standard rules
Documentation: Demo/loaner transactions tagged in ERP system (exclude from comp calculation).
### 6.5 Returns, Cancellations, Chargebacks
Scenario: Customer cancels order or returns product after rep received credit
Crediting: - Chargeback: Rep’s performance is reduced (clawback of credit) - Applies to rep who received original credit (even if they’ve left territory or company)
Timing: - Chargeback applied in month/quarter when cancellation occurs
Example:
Rep A credited $50,000 for order in Q1
Customer cancels in Q3
Q3 performance for Rep A reduced by $50,000 (chargeback)

If Rep A has left company, no retroactive collection (unless plan includes cash clawback).
Plan Language Required: Clawback provision must be in plan document and acknowledged by participant.
## 7. OVERLAY AND SPECIALIST ROLES
### 7.1 Overlay Structure
Scenario: Specialist (e.g., product specialist, solutions architect) supports field rep but also has own quota
Crediting: - Field Rep: Receives credit for full revenue (per standard rules) - Specialist: Receives credit for specific products/services (double crediting, but measured on different metrics)
Example:
Deal Total: $200,000
- Core products: $150,000
- Specialty products: $50,000

Field Rep (Territory Owner): $200,000 credit (entire deal)
Product Specialist: $50,000 credit (only specialty products)

Note: Each has different quota and plan; not splitting one pool.
### 7.2 Sales Engineer / Pre-Sales Support
Crediting: - Sales Engineer typically NOT directly commissioned on revenue - May receive team-based bonus or activity-based incentive (not deal credit)
## 8. CREDITING TIMEFRAMES
### 8.1 When Credit is Applied
Credit applied when: - Order is booked in ERP system (official system of record) - Date captured: Close date, booking date, or contract effective date (per company standard)
NOT when: - Verbal commitment (not yet booked) - Quote issued (not yet closed) - Invoice issued (too late - use booking date)
Company Standard: Credit applied on booking date (when order enters ERP).
### 8.2 Cut-Off Dates
For monthly plans: - Cut-off: Last day of month at 11:59 PM (per ERP system timestamp)
For quarterly plans: - Cut-off: Last day of quarter at 11:59 PM
No exceptions: Orders booked after cut-off count in next period.
## 9. CREDIT DISPUTES
### 9.1 How to Dispute Credit
If rep believes credit is incorrect:
Review Data: Check CRM and ICMT to understand how credit was assigned
Contact Sales Operations: Submit dispute per Dispute Resolution Procedures
Provide Evidence: CRM opportunity details, customer location, timeline, etc.
Timeline: Dispute must be raised within 30 days of performance period close.
### 9.2 Dispute Resolution Process
Step 1: Sales Operations Review - Review CRM data, territory assignments, policy rules - Determine correct crediting per policy
Step 2: Manager Decision - If policy unclear or judgment call needed, Sales Manager decides - Document rationale
Step 3: Appeal - If rep disagrees, may appeal to Sales VP - VP decision is final
Common Disputes: - Split percentage disagreement (both reps claim primary credit) - Territory boundary dispute (customer location unclear) - Timing dispute (when did territory change occur vs. deal close)
Resolution: Apply policy consistently; document precedent for future similar cases.
## 10. TERRITORY & ACCOUNT ASSIGNMENTS
### 10.1 Territory Master Data
Sales Operations maintains: - Territory maps (geographic boundaries or account lists) - Territory assignments (which rep owns which territory) - Effective dates of assignments
System of Record: CRM (Salesforce)
Updates: Sales Operations updates within 2 business days of change.
### 10.2 Account Assignment
How customers are assigned to territories: - Geographic: Customer location (billing or shipping address) - Named Accounts: Specific accounts assigned to specific reps (for strategic accounts) - Industry/Segment: By customer industry or size
Conflicts: If customer could belong to multiple territories, Sales Operations determines assignment (documented).
## 11. DATA INTEGRITY
### 11.1 Rep Responsibilities
Reps must: - Accurately log opportunities in CRM - Tag correct customer account - Update deal stage as sales progresses - Document any split credit agreements in CRM (before close)
Failure to Document: If split not documented in advance, Sales Operations will apply standard policy (may not be favorable to rep).
### 11.2 Sales Operations Audit
Quarterly: - Audit sample of transactions for crediting accuracy - Verify CRM data matches ERP data - Identify and correct errors
Annual: - Comprehensive review of territory assignments - Update territory maps - Clean up account assignments
