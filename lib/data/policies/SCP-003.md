# 1. Purpose
This policy establishes governance and treatment guidelines for windfall sales transactions and unusually large deals that have the potential to create disproportionate compensation outcomes. The policy ensures fair treatment of exceptional sales while maintaining the integrity and sustainability of Henry Schein's sales compensation program.
# 2. Scope
This policy applies to:
• All sales compensation plans with commission or bonus components
• All sales roles across Henry Schein divisions
• Individual transactions and multi-transaction deals meeting windfall criteria
• Both new business and expansion sales to existing customers
# 3. Definitions
Windfall Transaction: A single sales transaction or series of related transactions that meets one or more of the windfall criteria defined in Section 4 of this policy.
Large Deal: A transaction with contract value exceeding $1,000,000 or resulting in commission payment exceeding $100,000.
Disproportionate Outcome: A compensation result where a single transaction provides >50% of a sales representative's annual target incentive or >25% of annual quota attainment.
Sales Effort: The documented activities, time investment, relationship building, and strategic selling work performed by the sales representative to close the transaction.
Amortization: Spreading commission payments over multiple payment periods aligned with contract term or delivery schedule.
Split Credit: Dividing commission credit between multiple contributors based on their relative effort and contribution.
# 4. Windfall Identification Criteria
A transaction is classified as a potential windfall if it meets ANY of the following criteria:
## 4.1 Size-Based Criteria
• Transaction value exceeds $1,000,000
• Commission payment would exceed $100,000
• Single transaction represents >50% of annual quota
• Deal would result in annual quota attainment >200%
## 4.2 Effort-Based Criteria
• Sales cycle was unusually short (<30 days) relative to deal size
• Minimal sales rep involvement (customer-initiated inquiry, <5 touchpoints)
• Significant corporate support/involvement beyond normal selling
• Existing customer significantly expanding without competitive displacement
## 4.3 Circumstance-Based Criteria
• Deal resulted from corporate partnership or alliance
• Transaction driven primarily by marketing campaign or trade show
• Merger/acquisition bringing large customer into territory
• Industry consolidation creating large customer
# 5. Compensation Review Board (CRB) Review Process
## 5.1 Identification and Flagging
Sales Compensation monitors all transactions and automatically flags potential windfalls based on criteria in Section 4. Flagged deals are held for CRB review before commission payment is processed.
## 5.2 Information Package for CRB
For each windfall under review, the CRB receives:
• Transaction details (size, scope, timeline)
• Sales representative information (tenure, YTD performance, historical attainment)
• Sales effort documentation (activities, timeline, customer interactions)
• Commission calculation under standard plan rules
• Sales manager assessment and recommendation
• Comparable transaction analysis
• Proposed treatment options with financial impact
## 5.3 Review Timeline
• Flagged within 5 business days of deal closing
• Information package prepared within 10 business days
• CRB review completed within 15 business days
• Decision communicated to sales rep within 2 business days of CRB meeting
• Total timeline target: 30 days from deal close to decision
# 6. Windfall Treatment Options
The CRB may approve one or more of the following treatments based on the specific circumstances:
## 6.1 Option 1: Full Payment Under Plan (No Modification)
When to use:
• Sales rep demonstrated exceptional effort and sales strategy
• Deal was fully within rep's control and influence
• Competitive win or complex sales process
• Rep's overall performance is at or below target
Decision: Pay commission according to standard plan terms without modification.
## 6.2 Option 2: Commission Cap
When to use:
• Transaction significantly exceeds typical deal size for role
• Some sales effort but not commensurate with commission amount
• Need to maintain reasonable compensation/performance relationship
Implementation:
• Cap commission at 2x annual target incentive, or
• Cap at 150% of annual quota attainment contribution, or
• Cap at $250,000 total commission payment
Any excess commission above cap is absorbed (not paid).
## 6.3 Option 3: Amortization
When to use:
• Multi-year contract or phased delivery
• Payment timing misalignment with value delivery
• Risk mitigation for contract cancellation or non-payment
Implementation:
• Spread commission payments over contract term (up to 36 months)
• Align payments with customer payment milestones
• Align payments with product/service delivery schedule
• Payments subject to continued employment (unless otherwise specified)
Example: $300K commission on 3-year contract = $100K per year
## 6.4 Option 4: Split Credit
When to use:
• Multiple parties significantly contributed to sale
• Corporate team involvement (executives, product specialists, etc.)
• Transition from previous rep or inherited relationship
Implementation:
• Allocate commission among contributors based on documented effort
• Primary rep typically receives 50-70% of credit
• Supporting contributors receive 10-30% each
• Total allocation may exceed 100% for exceptional team selling
## 6.5 Option 5: Special Recognition Bonus
When to use:
• Deal has strategic importance beyond commission value
• Rep went above and beyond normal expectations
• Want to recognize effort while modifying standard commission
Implementation:
• Award discretionary bonus separate from commission plan
• Typical range: $25,000 - $100,000
• May be combined with capped or amortized commission
• Approved by CRB with CEO sign-off
## 6.6 Combination Approaches
The CRB may approve a combination of treatments. For example:
• Amortize commission over 3 years AND apply a $200K cap
• Split credit 70/30 AND provide special recognition bonus
• Cap commission at $150K AND amortize payment over 2 years

# 10. Examples and Scenarios
## Example 1: Full Payment Approved
Sales Rep closes $2M deal after 18-month sales cycle with new customer. Commission: $120K (60% of annual target incentive). Rep documented 200+ customer interactions, defeated three competitors, and demonstrated exceptional consultative selling. CRB Decision: Full payment under plan. Rep earned this through sustained effort.
## Example 2: Commission Cap Applied
Sales Rep closes $3M deal with existing customer expanding operations. Minimal competitive threat, 60-day sales cycle, customer largely self-directed. Commission would be $180K (3x annual target). CRB Decision: Cap at $100K. Deal was somewhat fortuitous and not fully attributable to sales effort.
## Example 3: Amortization Over Contract Term
$5M multi-year contract (5 years) with staggered delivery. Commission: $250K. CRB Decision: Amortize over 5 years at $50K annually, paid quarterly at $12,500. Aligns payment with contract value realization and reduces risk of non-payment or early termination.
## Example 4: Split Credit with Special Bonus
$1.5M strategic deal with C-suite involvement. Current rep closed deal, but previous rep built relationship over 3 years before transferring territories. Standard commission: $90K. CRB Decision: 60% to current rep ($54K), 40% to previous rep ($36K), plus $25K special recognition bonus to current rep for closing strategic account.
