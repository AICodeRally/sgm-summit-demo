# TERMINATION POLICY
## Compensation Treatment Upon Employment Termination
Document Owner: HR / Compensation Manager Version: 1.0 Effective Date: January 1, 2026 Legal Review: REQUIRED before implementation Last Updated: November 19, 2025 Next Review: Annual (January 2027)
## 1. PURPOSE
Establish clear, consistent guidelines for how employment termination affects incentive compensation to ensure: - Compliance with employment and wage laws - Fair and consistent treatment - Clear communication to terminating employees - Proper calculation and payment - Protection of company interests
## 2. SCOPE
Applies to all employees eligible for incentive compensation whose employment terminates for any reason: - Voluntary resignation - Involuntary termination (with or without cause) - Retirement - Death - Job elimination / layoff - Mutual separation
## 3. GENERAL PRINCIPLES
### 3.1 At-Will Employment
Employment is at-will (unless individual contract states otherwise)
Employer or employee may terminate at any time
Incentive comp does not create employment contract
### 3.2 Earned vs. Unearned Compensation
Earned: Compensation for performance already achieved and measured
Unearned: Future incentive opportunity not yet earned
### 3.3 Active Employment Requirement
General Rule: Must be actively employed on payment date to receive incentive payment
Exceptions: Specified below by termination type
## 4. TERMINATION TYPES & COMPENSATION TREATMENT
### 4.1 Voluntary Resignation
Definition: Employee initiates termination
Notice Requirement: [Typically 2 weeks]
Compensation Treatment:
Earned Comp for Completed Periods: - ☐ Paid: Incentive earned for completed performance periods - Example: Employee resigns March 15. Q1 (Jan-Mar) performance is complete. Q1 payment is paid per plan schedule (e.g., April 15).
Partial Period (Month/Quarter in Progress): - ☐ Forfeited: No payment for partial period unless specified below - ☐ Exception: If employee works >15 days in month, may be eligible for pro-rated payment (Company discretion)
Future Periods: - ☐ Forfeited: No payment for periods not yet worked
Payment Timing: - Earned comp paid on next regular payment date OR in final paycheck (per state wage law)
Example:
Employee resigns effective March 15, 2026

Completed Periods:
- Q4 2025: Paid (already processed)
- January 2026: Paid in final paycheck or next scheduled payment
- February 2026: Paid in final paycheck or next scheduled payment

Partial Period:
- March 1-15, 2026: Forfeited (partial month)

Future Periods:
- March 16-31, 2026 and beyond: Forfeited (not worked)
### 4.2 Involuntary Termination - Without Cause
Definition: Company initiates termination; employee not terminated for misconduct
Examples: - Performance-based termination (not meeting expectations) - Reorganization / role elimination - Position eliminated / layoff
Compensation Treatment:
Earned Comp for Completed Periods: - ☐ Paid: Incentive earned for completed performance periods up to termination date
Partial Period: - ☐ Pro-Rated: Payment for partial period based on days worked - Formula: Pro-Rated Payment = (Performance to Date / Pro-Rated Quota) × Target Incentive × (Days Worked / Total Days in Period)
Example:
Employee terminated March 15 (without cause)
Monthly quota: $100,000
Target incentive: $10,000/month
Performance Jan 1-March 15: $180,000
Days worked in March: 15 of 31 days

Calculation:
- January: $60K performance vs $100K quota = 60% × $10K = $6,000 (paid)
- February: $70K performance vs $100K quota = 70% × $10K = $7,000 (paid)
- March (partial): $50K performance vs pro-rated quota
  - Pro-rated March quota: $100K × (15/31) = $48,387
  - Attainment: $50K / $48,387 = 103.3%
  - Pro-rated payment: 103.3% × $10K × (15/31) = $5,000 (paid)

Total: $6,000 + $7,000 + $5,000 = $18,000
Future Periods: - ☐ Forfeited: No payment for periods not worked
Severance Impact: - If severance paid, incentive comp generally not included - Consult Legal and review severance agreement
### 4.3 Involuntary Termination - For Cause
Definition: Terminated for misconduct or violation of company policy
Examples: - Theft, fraud, dishonesty - Violation of code of conduct - Harassment or discrimination - Gross negligence - Insubordination
Compensation Treatment:
All Incentive Compensation: - ☐ Forfeited: All unpaid incentive compensation forfeited, including: - Completed periods not yet paid - Partial periods - Future periods
Clawback: - ☐ Company may seek recovery of incentive paid if: - Fraud or misconduct inflated performance results - Customer cancellations due to employee misconduct - See Clawback provisions (Section 6)
Example:
Employee terminated for cause March 15

All incentive forfeited:
- January 2026: Forfeited (even though earned)
- February 2026: Forfeited
- March 2026 (partial): Forfeited

Result: $0 payment
Legal Note: - State wage laws may require payment of earned wages - “Earned” may be interpreted differently by state law - Consult Legal before withholding any compensation
### 4.4 Retirement
Definition: Employee retires (typically age 55+ with 10+ years service, or per company retirement policy)
Compensation Treatment:
Earned Comp for Completed Periods: - ☐ Paid: Incentive earned for completed periods

Partial Period: - ☐ Pro-Rated and Paid: Payment for partial period, calculated as of date of death

Total: Full amount earned through date of death
Note: Handled with sensitivity and respect. Coordinate with HR and Legal.
### 4.6 Mutual Separation Agreement
Definition: Employee and company mutually agree to separation terms
