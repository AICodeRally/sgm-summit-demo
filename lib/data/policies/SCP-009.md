## Compensation Impact for Employee Leaves
Document Owner: HR / Compensation Manager Version: 1.0 Effective Date: January 1, 2026 Legal Review: REQUIRED before implementation Last Updated: November 19, 2025 Next Review: Annual (January 2027)
## 1. PURPOSE
Establish clear guidelines for how leaves of absence (LOAs) affect incentive compensation to ensure: - Compliance with federal and state leave laws - Fair and consistent treatment of employees on leave - Clear communication to affected employees - Proper calculation and payment procedures
## 2. SCOPE
Applies to all employees eligible for incentive compensation who take a leave of absence, including: - FMLA (Family and Medical Leave Act) leave - Military leave - Disability leave (short-term and long-term) - Personal leave - Parental leave (maternity, paternity, adoption) - Other company-approved leaves
## 3. TYPES OF LEAVE
### 3.1 Protected Leaves (FMLA, Military, etc.)
Federal/State Law Protection: - FMLA (up to 12 weeks) - Military leave (USERRA) - State-specific leave laws (vary by state) - Disability leave (may be protected under ADA)
Compensation Impact: - See Section 4 for detailed compensation treatment - Generally more favorable treatment than non-protected leaves - Compliance with law is paramount
### 3.2 Company-Approved Non-Protected Leaves
Examples: - Extended personal leave - Sabbatical - Education leave
Compensation Impact: - See Section 4 - Generally less favorable than protected leaves - Company discretion
### 3.3 Unauthorized Absence
Not a Leave of Absence: - Absence without approval - May result in termination - Compensation impacts per Termination Policy
## 4. COMPENSATION TREATMENT BY LEAVE TYPE
### 4.1 Short-Term Leave (<30 Days)
Eligibility: - ☐ Remains eligible for incentive plan - ☐ Continues to accrue performance credit
Quota/Goals: - ☐ No adjustment to quota or goals - ☐ Performance measured based on actual results
Payment: - ☐ Paid on normal schedule based on performance - ☐ No reduction or pro-ration for leave period
Rationale: Short absences (vacation, brief illness) are normal and expected; no adjustment needed.
### 4.2 Medium-Term Leave (30-90 Days)
Eligibility: - ☐ Remains eligible for incentive plan during leave - ☐ Performance credit may be paused (see below)
Quota/Goals: - ☐ Pro-rated based on active days Adjusted Quota = Annual Quota × (Active Days / Total Days in Period)
Performance Credit: - Option A (Preferred): Performance credit paused during leave; resumes upon return - Example: On leave Feb 1-Mar 31 (60 days). No credit for deals during that period. Credit resumes April 1. - Option B: Credit for in-flight deals closed during leave (if applicable to role)
Payment: - ☐ Paid on normal schedule based on pro-rated quota - ☐ Attainment calculated: Actual Performance / Pro-Rated Quota
### 4.3 Long-Term Leave (>90 Days)
Eligibility: - ☐ Suspended from incentive plan during leave period - ☐ Reinstated upon return to active status
Quota/Goals: - ☐ Suspended during leave - ☐ New quota assigned upon return (pro-rated for remaining period)
Performance Credit: - ☐ No credit for performance during leave period - ☐ Territory reassigned to interim coverage (if applicable)
Payment: - ☐ No incentive payments during leave - ☐ Upon return: Participate in plan for remaining period with pro-rated quota
Final Payment (if applicable): - ☐ Earned incentive for periods worked prior to leave paid out per plan terms - ☐ Example: Employee worked Q1, goes on leave Q2-Q3, returns Q4 - Q1 payment: Earned and paid - Q2-Q3 payment: Not eligible (on leave) - Q4 payment: Eligible with pro-rated Q4 quota
## 5. SPECIFIC LEAVE TYPES - DETAILED TREATMENT
### 5.1 FMLA Leave (Family & Medical Leave Act)
Legal Requirements: - Up to 12 weeks unpaid leave - Job protection - Benefits continuation - Cannot penalize employee for taking FMLA
Compensation Treatment:
Quota Adjustment: - ☐ Pro-rate quota for periods >30 days on FMLA - Formula: Adjusted Annual Quota = Original Quota × [(365 - FMLA Days) / 365]
Payment: - ☐ Eligible for payment based on pro-rated quota - ☐ Attainment calculated on adjusted quota - ☐ No penalty for taking FMLA leave
Example:
Employee on FMLA: March 1 - May 31 (90 days)
Annual Quota: $1,200,000
Active Days: 365 - 90 = 275 days

Pro-Rated Quota: $1,200,000 × (275/365) = $904,110

If employee achieves $900,000 in sales (active periods only):
Attainment = $900,000 / $904,110 = 99.5%
Compliance Note: - Must not discourage employees from taking FMLA - Quota pro-ration is permissible (employee not working) - Cannot reduce payout rate or change plan terms punitively
### 5.2 Parental Leave (Maternity, Paternity, Adoption)
Company Policy: [Specify company policy - e.g., 12 weeks paid parental leave]
Compensation Treatment:
If Paid Parental Leave (Company Benefit): - ☐ Quota pro-rated for time on leave >30 days - ☐ Eligible for incentive based on pro-rated quota - ☐ In-flight deals: Credit to returning parent if closes within 30 days of return; otherwise to interim coverage
If Unpaid (FMLA): - ☐ Treat per FMLA policy (Section 5.1 above)
Rationale: Support working parents while fairly adjusting for non-working time.
### 5.3 Military Leave (USERRA)
Legal Requirements: - Job protection - Benefits continuation - No adverse action due to military service
Compensation Treatment:
Quota: - ☐ Pro-rated for military leave period - ☐ Upon return, reinstated with adjusted quota
Payment: - ☐ Pay earned incentive for periods worked before leave - ☐ Eligible to participate upon return - ☐ Cannot penalize for military service
Reemployment: - ☐ Employee returns to same or similar position - ☐ Compensation plan participation restored - ☐ Pro-rated quota for remainder of year
Example:
Employee deploys June 1 - December 31 (7 months)
Worked Jan-May (5 months)

Pro-Rated Quota for Jan-May: Annual Quota × (151/365) = 41.4% of annual quota
Attainment for year calculated based on performance Jan-May vs. pro-rated quota
Compliance Note: - USERRA compliance is mandatory - Cannot discriminate against service members
### 5.4 Disability Leave (Short-Term & Long-Term)
Short-Term Disability (STD): Typically <6 months
Compensation Treatment: - ☐ Quota pro-rated if leave >30 days - ☐ Incentive paid based on pro-rated quota - ☐ Upon return, reinstated with adjusted quota for remaining period
Long-Term Disability (LTD): Typically >6 months
Compensation Treatment: - ☐ Suspended from active plan participation during LTD - ☐ No incentive payments during LTD period - ☐ If returns to work: Reinstated with pro-rated quota for remaining period - ☐ If unable to return: Treated per Termination Policy
Disability Payments: - LTD insurance provides income replacement - Incentive comp generally not included in LTD calculation (base salary only)
### 5.5 Personal/Sabbatical Leave (Non-Protected)
Eligibility: Company discretion; not legally required
Compensation Treatment:
Unpaid Personal Leave: - ☐ Suspended from plan during leave - ☐ Quota pro-rated upon return - ☐ No credit for performance during leave
Sabbatical (Paid Company Benefit): - ☐ Treat as short-term leave (<30 days) if sabbatical ≤30 days - ☐ Quota pro-rated if sabbatical >30 days - ☐ Eligible for incentive based on pro-rated quota
## 6. CALCULATION EXAMPLES
### Example 1: FMLA Leave (60 Days)
Scenario: - Employee takes FMLA April 1 - May 31 (60 days) - Annual Quota: $1,000,000 - Performance (active periods only): $800,000
Calculation:
Active Days: 365 - 60 = 305 days
Pro-Rated Quota: $1,000,000 × (305/365) = $835,616

Attainment: $800,000 / $835,616 = 95.7%

Payout: 95.7% × Target Incentive = [Amount]
Result: Employee paid based on 95.7% attainment (not penalized for leave).
### Example 2: Long-Term Disability (6 Months)
Scenario: - Employee on LTD July 1 - December 31 (184 days) - Annual Quota: $1,200,000 - Performance Jan-June: $550,000
Calculation:
Active Period: Jan 1 - June 30 (181 days)
Pro-Rated Quota for Active Period: $1,200,000 × (181/365) = $595,068

Attainment for Active Period: $550,000 / $595,068 = 92.4%

Payout: 92.4% × Target Incentive (pro-rated for 6 months) = [Amount]
Result: Employee paid for Jan-June performance only; not eligible Jul-Dec while on LTD.
