# 1. Purpose
This policy establishes compliance standards and procedures for Internal Revenue Code Section 409A, which governs deferred compensation arrangements. The policy ensures Henry Schein's compensation plans comply with Section 409A requirements to avoid significant tax penalties for the company and employees.
# 2. Scope
This policy applies to:
• All deferred compensation arrangements as defined by Section 409A
• Sales compensation plans with payment timing features
• Equity-based compensation with deferral provisions
• Severance agreements and retention programs
• All U.S.-based employees and independent contractors
# 3. Section 409A Overview
## 3.1 What is Section 409A?
Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code imposes strict requirements on non-qualified deferred compensation plans. It regulates when compensation can be deferred, when it must be paid, and what elections participants can make regarding payment timing.
## 3.2 Why Compliance Matters
Non-compliance with Section 409A results in severe consequences for employees:
• Immediate income inclusion (even if payment not received)
• Additional 20% penalty tax on deferred amounts
• Interest penalties from original deferral date
• No corresponding deduction for employer
These penalties can result in employees paying taxes exceeding 60% of deferred amounts.
# 4. Definitions
Deferred Compensation: Any arrangement under which an employee has a legally binding right to compensation in one year that is payable in a subsequent year. This is broader than traditional 'voluntary deferral' plans.
Short-Term Deferral Exception: Payments made by the 15th day of the third month following the end of the year in which the compensation vests are exempt from Section 409A.
Specified Employee: A key employee as defined by Section 409A (generally officers, 5% owners, or highly compensated employees). Special payment delay rules apply.
Separation from Service: Termination of employment as defined by Section 409A regulations (not necessarily same as company's termination definition).
Permissible Payment Events: The six events under Section 409A that can trigger deferred compensation payments: separation from service, disability, death, specified time/fixed schedule, change in control, or unforeseeable emergency.
# 5. Identification of Section 409A Covered Arrangements
## 5.1 Arrangements Subject to Section 409A
The following arrangements ARE subject to Section 409A:
• Commission payments made more than 2.5 months after year-end
• Annual bonuses paid after March 15 of the following year
• Multi-year incentive plans with payment delays
• Severance payments exceeding 2x compensation limit
• Retention bonuses with future payment dates
• Change-in-control payments not meeting safe harbor exceptions
## 5.2 Arrangements Generally Exempt from Section 409A
The following arrangements are NOT subject to Section 409A (if properly structured):
• Commissions/bonuses paid by March 15 following year earned
• Qualified retirement plans (401(k), pension plans)
• Stock options granted at fair market value
• Restricted stock (not RSUs)
• Severance up to 2x annual compensation (if paid within 2 years)
• Vacation/PTO payouts
## 5.3 Gray Areas Requiring Analysis
Some arrangements require case-by-case analysis with Legal/Tax:
• Clawback provisions with repayment timing beyond current year
• Discretionary bonus programs with undefined payment timing
• Earnout provisions in acquisition agreements
• Amortized commission payments on multi-year contracts
# 6. Payment Timing Rules and Requirements
## 6.1 Short-Term Deferral Safe Harbor
To avoid Section 409A, compensation should be paid by the 15th day of the 3rd month following the end of the year in which it vests (becomes no longer subject to substantial risk of forfeiture).
Examples:
• 2025 commission earned and vested: Must pay by March 15, 2026
• Annual bonus for FY 2025: Must pay by March 15, 2026
• Commission on deal closed December 31, 2025: Must pay by March 15, 2026
## 6.2 Specified Employees - 6-Month Delay Rule
For 'specified employees' (key employees), payments triggered by separation from service must be delayed 6 months from separation date.
Requirements:
• HR identifies specified employees annually (as of December 31)
• List effective April 1 of following year
• Separation-triggered payments delayed 6 months (or until death if earlier)
• No interest accrues during 6-month delay
## 6.3 Permissible Payment Events
Section 409A limits payment triggers to these six events:
1. Separation from service
2. Death
3. Disability (as defined in regulations)
4. Specified time or fixed schedule (e.g., 'January 1, 2028')
5. Change in control of company (meeting safe harbor definition)
6. Unforeseeable emergency (very limited circumstances)
Plan documents must specify which of these events trigger payment. Vague language like 'when determined by the committee' is NOT compliant.
# 7. Plan Document Requirements
## 7.1 Required Plan Provisions
All compensation plans subject to Section 409A must include:
• Specific payment timing tied to permissible payment events
• No discretion to accelerate or delay payments (except as permitted by regulations)
• Specified employee identification and 6-month delay provisions
• Prohibition on impermissible acceleration
• Section 409A savings clause
• Definition of separation from service consistent with Section 409A
## 7.2 Section 409A Savings Clause
Every plan document should include a Section 409A savings clause such as:
"This Plan is intended to comply with or be exempt from Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, if any plan provision would cause a participant to incur additional tax or penalties under Section 409A, that provision shall be reformed to avoid such tax or penalties while maintaining, to the maximum extent possible, the original intent and economic benefit to the participant."
## 7.3 Problematic Language to Avoid
Do NOT use these phrases in plan documents:
• 'Payment at company's discretion'
• 'Payable when determined by committee'
• 'Upon termination, in company's sole discretion'
• 'As soon as administratively practicable' (too vague)
Instead use:
• 'Payable by March 15, 2026'
• 'Within 30 days following separation from service (subject to 6-month delay for specified employees)'
• 'In the first payroll period following [specific date]'
# 8. Annual Compliance Review Procedures
## 8.1 Q4 Annual Review Process
Each year by November 30, Sales Compensation and Legal conduct Section 409A compliance review:
Step 1: Inventory All Compensation Plans
• Identify all active sales compensation plans
• Document payment timing for each plan
• Flag plans with payments after March 15
Step 2: Section 409A Applicability Analysis
• Determine which plans are subject to Section 409A
• Identify plans relying on short-term deferral exception
• Document other applicable exceptions
Step 3: Plan Document Review
• Review payment timing language in all covered plans
• Verify Section 409A savings clauses are included
• Confirm specified employee provisions are present
• Identify any non-compliant language
Step 4: Operational Compliance Review
• Review actual payment practices for past year
• Identify any payments made outside plan terms
• Assess specified employee payment delays
• Document any compliance issues
Step 5: Remediation Plan
• Develop corrective action plan for any issues
• Prioritize plan document amendments
• Implement process improvements
• Document completion timeline
## 8.2 New Plan Review
Before implementing any new compensation plan, Sales Compensation must:
• Submit draft plan document to Legal for Section 409A review
• Allow minimum 2 weeks for legal review
• Obtain written approval from Legal before finalizing
• Document approval in plan file
## 8.3 Specified Employee Identification
Annual process for identifying specified employees:
• HR runs specified employee analysis as of December 31
• Applies IRS criteria: officers, 5% owners, top-paid employees
• List finalized by January 31
• Effective April 1 for following 12 months
• Payroll flagged to apply 6-month delay for specified employees
# 9. Penalties for Non-Compliance
## 9.1 Employee Penalties
Employees subject to deferred compensation in violation of Section 409A face:
• Immediate income inclusion of all deferred amounts (even if not yet paid)
• 20% additional tax penalty on deferred compensation
• Interest penalties calculated from year of deferral
• Effective tax rate can exceed 60% of deferred amount
## 9.2 Company Impact
While Section 409A penalties apply primarily to employees, company faces:
• Reputational risk and employee relations damage
• Potential loss of tax deduction if amount never paid
• Increased reporting complexity (Form W-2 corrections)
• Possible litigation from affected employees
• IRS scrutiny of other compensation arrangements
## 9.3 Correction Programs
IRS provides limited correction programs for Section 409A errors:
• Document failures can sometimes be corrected retroactively
• Operational failures have narrow correction windows
• Early detection is critical for effective correction
• Not all failures are correctable
# 10. Examples and Scenarios
## Example 1: Compliant Annual Commission Plan
Sales Rep earns commissions throughout 2025. Plan states: 'Commissions paid monthly, with final payment by February 28, 2026.' This meets short-term deferral exception (within 2.5 months of year-end). Section 409A does NOT apply. No special documentation required.
## Example 2: Non-Compliant Payment Delay
Annual bonus for 2025 performance paid in April 2026 (beyond March 15). This IS subject to Section 409A. Plan document must specify payment date (e.g., 'April 15, 2026') and include Section 409A compliance provisions. Cannot say 'payable when approved by committee' - must be fixed date or formula.
## Example 3: Specified Employee Separation
VP of Sales (specified employee) terminates employment June 1, 2026. Has $150K in accrued deferred compensation. Payment must be delayed until December 1, 2026 (6 months after separation). If paid in June, VP would owe 20% penalty tax plus interest. Six-month delay is mandatory, not optional.
## Example 4: Multi-Year Amortized Commission
Large deal commission of $300K amortized over 3 years ($100K per year). This IS subject to Section 409A. Plan must specify: 'Payment of $100,000 on each of January 15, 2026, 2027, and 2028, provided participant remains employed (or if earlier, upon death or disability as defined in Section 409A).' Cannot retain discretion to accelerate or delay payments.
