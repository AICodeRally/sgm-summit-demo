   - Customer cancels contract within 180 days of close
   - Amount: Proportional to refund issued to customer
   - Example: Customer buys $100K, cancels 2 months later → Commission clawed back

   - Amount: Proportional to revenue reduction
   - Example: $50K refund issued → Proportional commission clawed back

3. **Deal Not Consummated**
   - Contract signed but customer never activates/deploys
   - No revenue recognized by accounting
   - Commission clawed back after 90-day grace period

4. **Compliance Violation**
   - Rep violated company policy in obtaining deal
   - Example: Unauthorized incentive, breach of contract
   - Partial or full clawback depending on violation severity

5. **Fraud or Misconduct**
   - Rep obtained deal through fraudulent means
   - Example: Falsifying customer information, unauthorized promises
   - Full clawback plus potential additional action

6. **Accounting Adjustment**
