# WINDFALL & LARGE DEAL GOVERNANCE POLICY

**Policy Code:** SCP-007
**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** APPROVED
**Effective Date:** January 1, 2026

---

## PURPOSE

Establish governance for unusually large or windfall transactions to ensure fair treatment and strategic alignment.

---

## WINDFALL IDENTIFICATION

**Deal is considered "Windfall" if ANY of these apply:**

1. **Deal size >$1M ARR** - Unusually large contract
2. **Commission payout >$100K** - High individual payout
3. **Deal represents >50% of quarterly quota** - Disproportionate to typical
4. **Deal is unusual for territory** - Out of pattern (e.g., $5M from territory typically $500K)

---

## WINDFALL REVIEW PROCESS

### Mandatory CRB Review

**All windfall deals subject to review:**
- Deal details submitted to CRB within 5 business days of close
- CRB has 20 business days to review and decide
- Communication to rep within 5 days of decision

### CRB Decision Options

**Option 1: Full Payment**
- No modification to commission
- Standard payout per plan
- Most common if deal is legitimate and well-earned

**Option 2: Commission Cap**
- Maximum commission paid: 2x target monthly incentive (or $250K, whichever is lower)
- Applied if payout would be extreme
- Example: Target incentive $100K/month → max commission $200K on windfall

**Option 3: Amortization**
- Commission spread over contract term (up to 36 months)
- Example: 3-year contract → commission paid over 3 years
- Applies if rep will benefit from implementation/retention
- Rationale: Rep responsible for ongoing success

**Option 4: Split Credit**
- Commission split among multiple contributors
- Example: Large deal with team support → split between AE and supporting reps
- Percentage split documented in decision

**Option 5: Special Recognition Bonus**
- Fixed bonus amount ($25K-$100K)
- In lieu of full commission or reduced commission
- Recognizes extraordinary effort
- Timing: Separate from regular commission

**Option 6: No Payment (Rare)**
- Applied only if deal is questionable or non-compliant
- Requires extensive documentation
- Full appeals process available

## DECISION CRITERIA

CRB considers:
- **Legitimacy:** Is deal real and properly credited to rep?
- **Effort:** How much effort did this rep truly invest?
- **Sustainability:** Will rep need to support ongoing relationship?
- **Pattern:** Is this an outlier or part of normal business?
- **Market Conditions:** Were there unusual external factors?
- **Peer Comparison:** How does this compare to similar deals?

---

## DOCUMENTATION

**CRB Decision Log Includes:**
- Deal details (customer, size, term, ARR)
- Rep name and territory
- Original commission under plan
- CRB decision (option selected)
- Rationale and reasoning
- Approvals (CRB members)
- Communication to rep
- Implementation (how payment will be calculated)

**All decisions documented in precedent file (for future consistency)**

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Mega-Deal (Option 1 - Full Payment)

**Scenario:**
- New Logo: $3M ARR, 3-year contract
- Rep commission under plan: $180K
- Rep earned deal legitimately from prospect in territory
- Deal is largest in company history

**CRB Decision:** Full Payment ($180K)
- Rationale: Legitimate, well-earned, rep did extensive work
- No override needed - rep deserves full commission

### Example 2: Expansion (Option 3 - Amortization)

**Scenario:**
- Existing customer expansion: $2M additional ARR
- Original contract: $1M (rep earned $60K commission)
- New expansion: $2M (would earn $120K under plan)
- Rep will implement expansion over 12-month deployment

**CRB Decision:** Amortize over 12 months
- Rationale: Rep responsible for successful implementation
- Rep receives $10K/month for 12 months instead of lump sum
- Incentivizes success and customer satisfaction

### Example 3: Team Deal (Option 4 - Split Credit)

**Scenario:**
- Large deal: $5M ARR, multiple teams involved
- AE primary: $200K commission under plan
- SE massive support: Demo, POC, architecture
- CSM helped retain customer in competitive situation

**CRB Decision:** Split credit
- AE: 60% ($120K) - primary relationship owner
- SE: 25% ($50K) - critical technical support
- CSM: 15% ($30K) - retention support

### Example 4: Cap (Option 2 - Commission Cap)

**Scenario:**
- Mega-deal: $10M ARR (company-wide strategic account)
- Rep commission under plan: $500K
- Target monthly incentive: $100K
- Deal is 2x target annual commission in single deal

**CRB Decision:** Cap at $200K
- Rationale: Payout would be excessive relative to role
- Rep still gets significant payout ($200K) but not unlimited
- Prevents extreme windfalls from distorting compensation

---

## APPEALS

**If rep disagrees with windfall treatment:**
1. Submit written appeal within 10 business days
2. Include additional information/context
3. CRB reviews appeal (may request additional info)
4. CRB issues final decision within 10 business days
5. No further appeals after this level

---

## SPECIAL SITUATIONS

### Acquisition or M&A Deal

- Customer acquisition as part of M&A: Usually treated as New Logo
- Special approval may apply if integrated customer
- CRB reviews for appropriate treatment

### Customer Consolidation

- Customer consolidates multiple contracts into single large deal
- Not a "windfall" if normal business
- May be capped if consolidation is artificial

### Territory/Account Transition Deal

- Rep new to territory closes large deal from predecessor
- Credit typically goes to rep who closed deal
- No automatic cap (earned legitimately)
