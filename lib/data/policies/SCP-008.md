Types: - New Hire Guarantee: For new sales hires during ramp period - Performance Guarantee: During territory transition or plan changes - Market Guarantee: To attract/retain talent in competitive market
## 4. WHEN DRAWS/GUARANTEES ARE APPROPRIATE
### 4.1 New Hire Situations

## 6. DRAW MECHANICS
### 6.1 How Draws Work
Monthly Draw Example:
Employee receives $5,000/month draw for 6 months

Month 1:
- Draw Paid: $5,000
- Commissions Earned: $2,000
- Net: Employee receives $5,000 (draw covers shortfall)

Month 2:
- Draw Paid: $5,000
- Commissions Earned: $7,000
- Net: Employee receives $7,000 ($5,000 draw + $2,000 overage)

Month 3:
- Draw Paid: $5,000
- Commissions Earned: $3,000
- Net: Employee receives $5,000 (draw covers shortfall)

Month 7 (after draw period ends):
- No draw
- Commissions Earned: $8,000
- Net: Employee receives $8,000 (full commission)
### 6.2 Draw Reconciliation
Monthly Reconciliation: 1. Calculate earned commissions for the month 2. Compare to draw amount 3. Pay higher of: draw or earned commissions 4. Track cumulative draw vs. earned (for reporting, not recovery if non-recoverable)
End of Draw Period: - Employee transitions to standard commission plan - No repayment required (if non-recoverable) - Final reconciliation statement provided
Example Reconciliation Statement:
6-Month Draw Summary for John Smith

Total Draw Paid: $30,000 (6 months × $5,000)
Total Commissions Earned: $22,000
Difference: $8,000 (draw exceeded earnings)

Status: Non-recoverable draw - no repayment required

Effective Month 7: Standard commission plan (no draw)
## 7. GUARANTEE MECHANICS
### 7.1 How Guarantees Work
Example:
New hire guarantee: $5,000/month for 6 months

Each month, employee receives the GREATER of:
- Guarantee amount ($5,000), OR
- Earned commission

Month 1: Earned $1,000 → Paid $5,000 (guarantee)
Month 2: Earned $3,000 → Paid $5,000 (guarantee)
Month 3: Earned $6,000 → Paid $6,000 (earnings exceed guarantee)
Month 4: Earned $4,000 → Paid $5,000 (guarantee)
Month 5: Earned $7,500 → Paid $7,500 (earnings exceed guarantee)
Month 6: Earned $8,000 → Paid $8,000 (earnings exceed guarantee)

Total Paid: $5,000 + $5,000 + $6,000 + $5,000 + $7,500 + $8,000 = $36,500
Total Guarantee: $30,000
Employee earned $6,500 above guarantee
### 7.2 Guarantee vs. Earned Commission
Employee Always Receives Higher Amount: - If earned commission < guarantee → Paid guarantee - If earned commission > guarantee → Paid earned commission (employee does better than guarantee)
No “Give Back”: - Once guarantee period ends, employee doesn’t repay - Employee keeps all payments received
## 8. APPROVAL PROCESS
### 8.1 Approval Authority
| Amount | Duration | Approval Required |
| <$15,000 total | ≤3 months | Sales Operations Manager |
| $15,000-$50,000 total | ≤6 months | Compensation Manager + Sales Manager |
| $50,000-$100,000 total | ≤12 months | VP Sales + Compensation Manager |
| >$100,000 total | Any duration | CFO + VP Sales |
| Executive level | Any amount | CFO + CEO (or Board if required) |

Total = Amount × Duration Example: $5,000/month × 6 months = $30,000 total → Requires Comp Manager + Sales Manager approval
### 8.2 Request Process
Step 1: Submit Request - Sales Manager submits Draw/Guarantee Request Form (Appendix A) - Include: Business justification, amount, duration, candidate/employee info
Step 2: Review - Compensation team reviews request - Verifies within policy limits - Assesses precedent and consistency - Recommends approval or denial

### 9.2 Legal Review
Legal review required for: - Recoverable draws (always) - Guarantees >$100,000 total - Executive guarantees (always) - Non-standard terms
## 10. TERMINATION DURING DRAW/GUARANTEE PERIOD
### 10.1 Voluntary Resignation
Non-Recoverable Draw: - ☐ Employee keeps all draw payments received - ☐ No repayment required - ☐ No further draw payments after termination date
Recoverable Draw: - ☐ Employee may owe repayment of unearned portion - ☐ Calculate earned commissions vs. total draw paid - ☐ Consult Legal before pursuing collection
Guarantee: - ☐ Guarantee payments stop at termination date - ☐ No further payments - ☐ Employee keeps payments received to date
### 10.2 Involuntary Termination - Without Cause
Treatment: - ☐ Pro-rate guarantee for partial month - ☐ No further payments after termination - ☐ Employee keeps all prior payments
Example:
Employee terminated Feb 15
Guarantee: $5,000/month
Days worked in Feb: 15 of 28

Pro-rated final payment: $5,000 × (15/28) = $2,679
Total paid in February: $2,679
### 10.3 Involuntary Termination - For Cause
Treatment: - ☐ Draw/guarantee payments stop immediately - ☐ No pro-ration - ☐ Company may seek recovery (if recoverable draw and misconduct inflated results)
Consult Legal before withholding any payment
## 11. TAX & ACCOUNTING TREATMENT
### 11.1 Tax Treatment
Draws and Guarantees are Taxable Compensation: - Subject to income tax withholding - Subject to FICA/Medicare - Reported on W-2
Tax Rate: - Typically supplemental wage rate (22% federal, varies by state) - Same as bonus/commission payments
### 11.2 Accounting Treatment
Draws: - Accrued as expense when paid - May create deferred asset if recoverable and recovery expected
Guarantees: - Accrued as compensation expense over guarantee period - Budgeted as part of sales compensation
Consult Finance for specific accounting treatment
## 12. MONITORING & REPORTING
### 12.1 Active Draw/Guarantee Tracking
Compensation team maintains tracker:
| Employee | Type | Amount | Start Date | End Date | Total Paid | Total Earned | Status |
| John Doe | Guarantee | $5K/mo | 1/1/26 | 6/30/26 | $25K (5 mo) | $18K | Active |
| Jane Smith | Draw | $4K/mo | 2/1/26 | 4/30/26 | $12K (3 mo) | $15K | Complete |

Monthly Review: - Verify all active draws/guarantees processed - Reconcile earned commissions vs. draw/guarantee - Flag upcoming expirations (30 days out)
### 12.2 Quarterly Reporting to CRB
Metrics: - Number of active draws/guarantees - Total financial commitment ($ outstanding) - By type (new hire, territory, retention, etc.) - Approval rate (# requests vs. # approved) - Effectiveness (% of employees exceeding guarantee by end)
Trends: - Are draws/guarantees increasing or decreasing? - Are they achieving intended purpose (retention, ramp success)? - Are limits being followed?
### 12.3 Annual Review
Assess Policy Effectiveness: - Success rate (% of new hires with guarantee who succeed long-term) - Cost vs. benefit (retention achieved vs. $ spent) - Policy compliance (were limits followed?) - Recommendations for policy updates
## 13. RAMPING SCHEDULES (ALTERNATIVE TO GUARANTEE)
Alternative to flat guarantee: Ramping quota
Example:
New hire standard quota: $100,000/month
Target incentive: $10,000/month (10% of quota)

Ramping Quota Schedule:
Month 1: 25% quota = $25,000 (easier to achieve, higher attainment %)
Month 2: 50% quota = $50,000
Month 3: 75% quota = $75,000
Month 4+: 100% quota = $100,000

This achieves similar effect as guarantee (higher payout during ramp) without fixed guarantee payment.
Pros: - Maintains incentive (pay for performance) - No guarantee reconciliation needed - Cleaner administration
Cons: - Less certain income for employee - May not be competitive with market offers that include guarantee
Use: Discuss with Compensation Manager whether ramping quota or guarantee is more appropriate for situation.
## 14. BEST PRACTICES
### 14.1 Do’s
✅ Use guarantees for new hires in long sales cycle roles
✅ Set clear end date and communicate transition plan
✅ Document everything in writing
✅ Make guarantees non-recoverable (simpler, lower risk)
✅ Track and report to ensure policy compliance
✅ Review effectiveness (are guaranteed employees succeeding?)
### 14.2 Don’ts
❌ Use guarantees to solve performance problems (doesn’t work)
❌ Provide open-ended guarantees (always time-limit)
❌ Exceed policy limits without proper approval
❌ Use recoverable draws (legal complexity, wage law risk)
❌ Make verbal guarantees (must be in writing)
❌ Forget to communicate end date (employee expects guarantee to continue)
## 15. STATE LAW CONSIDERATIONS
Wage Laws Vary by State:
Key Considerations: - California: Advances and draws subject to specific rules; consult Legal - New York: Commission pay regulated; ensure compliance - Other states: Vary; some prohibit recovery of draws
Before Implementing Recoverable Draw: - MUST consult Legal - Verify state law permits recovery - Obtain written employee consent
This policy assumes non-recoverable draws/guarantees to minimize legal risk.
