## Overview

SPARCC (Sales Performance, Alignment, Recognition, Compensation & Communication) is the foundational framework for designing and implementing compensation plans.

## Key Principles

### 1. Strategic Alignment
- Compensation plans must align with business objectives
- Link pay to performance metrics that drive revenue growth
- Ensure quota allocation reflects territory potential

### 2. Performance Measurement
- Define clear, measurable performance indicators
- Establish baseline performance levels
- Set realistic but challenging targets

### 3. Recognition & Rewards
- Timely recognition of achievement
- Competitive compensation packages
- Non-monetary recognition programs

### 4. Compensation Structure
- Base salary + variable compensation
- Commission rates tied to quota attainment
- Accelerators for exceeding targets
- Caps and thresholds clearly defined

### 5. Communication
- Transparent plan documentation
- Regular updates on performance
- Clear dispute resolution process

## Compliance Requirements

All compensation plans must:
- Include clear eligibility criteria
- Define payment schedules and timing
- Specify proration rules for mid-period hires
- Document exception handling procedures
- Establish governance oversight (SGCC/CRB approval)

## Governance Framework

- **Approval Authority**: SGCC for standard plans, CRB for exceptions
- **Review Cycle**: Annual review required
- **Amendment Process**: Requires executive approval for mid-year changes
- **Audit Requirements**: Quarterly compliance audits
